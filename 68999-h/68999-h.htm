<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
JACK LOVAT
</h3>

<p>
Those stirring times are days of the past, and
the unsheathed sword has given place to the
ploughshare, but weird pictures of bloodshed
among man and beast are indelibly impressed
on Jack Lovat's brain, and his dreams of to-day
are often linked with the scenes enacted during
the "White Men's War" beneath the glittering
Southern Cross.
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat was not a Colonial bred and
born, for his boyhood had been passed amid
the peaceful surroundings of a Highland sheep
farm in dear old Scotland.  Mr. Lovat, Jack's
father, had been a laird of substantial means,
and was descended from a line of ancestors in
whose veins coursed a strain of royal blood;
but bad times came, and Jack, instead of
proceeding to Loretto, took passage as a member
of the Lovat family, in a Castle liner bound
for Cape Town.
</p>

<p>
Jack was seventeen at the time our story
opens.  Rather above the middle height, he
was broad, and his bronzed features testified
to his three years' sojourn on the South African
veldt.
</p>

<p>
The Kaffirs on his father's ostrich farm, near
Orangefontein, had dubbed him "The Strong-armed
Baas," only a month later than his
advent to the holding locally known as "The
Kopje Farm."
</p>

<p>
Pete, the Kaffir who acted as native foreman
to Mr. Lovat, declared that "Baas Jack"
could fell the biggest ox ever inspanned in
a Cape waggon, which of course was an
exaggeration of a very bad type, but to which
statement Pete and the other "boys" employed
on the estate pinned implicit faith.
</p>

<p>
The dogs of war had been let loose in
South Africa, but Orangefontein had not been
troubled as yet.  Ladysmith, Kimberley, and
gallant little tin-roofed Mafeking had been
besieged and relieved, but round the homes of
the settlers near Ookiep and Orangefontein
tranquillity reigned.
</p>

<p>
On the outbreak of hostilities, Jack Lovat
had begged his father to allow him to join a
Colonial mounted corps, but Mr. Lovat withheld
his permission.
</p>

<p>
"No, boy," said the ostrich farmer; "we will
defend our home to the last, and I can't spare
you; so say no more about it.  It will be quite
time for us to take up arms when the Boers
come round here."  So Jack, with a somewhat
bad grace, had to rest content, and busy himself
with attending to the ostriches and the big
fruit farm on the bank of the Zak River.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon during the African winter,
Jack and Pete were engaged in rounding up
the ostriches.  Mr. Lovat had left early in
the morning for Springbokfontein.  He had
driven over to the town in a light Cape cart,
in whose shafts was Bessie&mdash;a favourite mare,
foaled on the farm, and belonging to Mary
Lovat, Jack's sister.
</p>

<p>
Bessie was known to be the fastest roadster
in the district, and was as playful as a kitten,
and never was a horse better loved than was
Bessie by Mary Lovat.
</p>

<p>
The ostrich farmer had promised Mrs. Lovat
that he would be home soon after midday, and
it was now four hours past that time; so Jack
was naturally anxious.
</p>

<p>
In a cowhide portmanteau Mr. Lovat had
taken five hundred sovereigns, intended for
deposit in Springbokfontein Bank.  The town
guard in Springbokfontein was exceptionally
strong, and Mr. Lovat, after much discussion
with his wife and Jack, had decided to deposit
the gold for safe keeping in the bank, instead
of, as Mrs. Lovat at first suggested, hiding it
in some carefully marked spot on the kopje,
in case of the advent of the Boers.
</p>

<p>
The ostriches having been penned up in
Cromarty Kraal&mdash;so called from his mother's
maiden name&mdash;Jack turned to Pete and said,
"My father is late.  I hope he is all right."
</p>

<p>
"De baas will come in his own good time,"
observed Pete; "he will be able to take good
care ob himself.  Dere be no Boers about
here."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see some of them come,"
said Jack, with a laugh.  "I think we could
give a good account of them.  Let me see,"
and the young settler began to count on his
fingers; "there's you, Pete, and Saul, Moses,
Jethro, Simon, Zacchary, Daniel, Obadiah,
and I must not forget Pat, besides my father
and self.  That makes eleven, doesn't it?
With the rifles and ammunition we got from
Port Nolloth, and inside our strong walls, we
could keep a commando at bay."
</p>

<p>
Jack's enthusiasm began to rise, and he went
on: "I hope some of the beggars do come
down upon us.  I want to try my rifle upon
something better than springbok and
hartebeeste.  What say you, Pete?"
</p>

<p>
A broad grin spread over the Kaffir's face,
as he replied, "I dunno, Baas Jack.  I no
want a Mauser bullet through my skin.  All
de same, baas, if de time eber comes, Pete will
be found ready to lay down his life for de baas,
missis, little missie, an' you."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, Pete! spoken like a man!" cried
Jack, who nearly so far forgot himself as to
shake hands with the Kaffir.  "And now,
Pete, let us go round and see what the boys
are doing."
</p>

<p>
Kopje Farm well deserved its appellation,
for it stood on the middle spur of a high,
flat-topped range of hills.  The building had been
erected many years before by a Dutch settler,
when trouble was rife with the Bantus, and its
thick stone walls, loopholed here and there,
gave it the appearance of a fort.  Around the
dwelling-house ran a wall of stone, some six
feet in height and correspondingly thick, which
had continuations to the ostrich kraal, where
the birds were penned at night.
</p>

<p>
Jack found that the "boys" had finished
their task of fastening up the ostriches
committed to their charge, and were standing in
a group, chattering in their guttural Kaffir
tongue.  A few yards away was Pat O'Neill,
an Irishman hailing from the wilds of
Connaught, who had followed the fortunes of
the Lovat family as general factotum from the
day the Scotch laird had landed in the colony.
</p>

<p>
Jack's quick eye glanced at the Kaffirs, after
which he strode towards the place where Pat
was standing contemplatively smoking a short
black duddeen.  Pat on seeing his young master
approach, came instantly to the salute; for the
Connemara man, twenty years before, had
formed one of the glorious defenders of Rorke's
Drift.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Saul?" inquired Jack of the
Irishman.
</p>

<p>
"He has gone on an errand for the mistress,
sorr," answered Pat.  "One of Master Butler's
children down the valley is laid up wid fever,
an' the mistress, who is good to every one, has
sent some cooling medicine for the poor thing,
which will do it good, please God.  Has the
master returned from Springbokfontein?"
</p>

<p>
"He has not arrived yet, Pat," answered
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall be mighty glad when I see
him," observed the Irishman.
</p>

<p>
"Things are all right, Pat," said Jack,
forcing a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"They may be, and may not be, sorr,"
remarked Pat.  "Zacchary has just told me
that a commando of Boers under the daring
leader, Christian Uys, is trekking this way.
The last time the Boers were heard of they
were in the Upper Zak River district.  How
in the world these niggers get news, sorr, is
more than Pat O'Neill, late corporal in the
ould 24th Regiment, can understand.  Shall
I saddle up and go to meet the master,
sorr?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bad idea, Pat.  Just wait a moment
until I see mother;" and Jack went inside the
farmhouse, where he found Mrs. Lovat peering
through a window at the long winding road
leading down the valley towards Springbokfontein.
</p>

<p>
Hearing footsteps, Mrs. Lovat turned round,
and seeing Jack, said, "I'm dreadfully anxious
about your father, Jack.  I cannot understand
why he has not returned.  It is so unlike him
to disappoint me."
</p>

<p>
"He'll be all right, mother," observed Jack
cheerfully.  "Very probably he has met some
one he has not seen for a time.  He is sure to
be here before nightfall.  Did he take any
lamps?  I was busy branding an ostrich when
he went away."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he trimmed the lamps and put them
on before he set out," answered Mrs. Lovat.
"I was rather surprised, as I thought he would
not need them."
</p>

<p>
"These South African roads are not good,
and people are delayed sometimes," said Jack.
"Pat is going down the road to meet him, so
cheer up, mother.  Where is Mary?"
</p>

<p>
"She has a bad headache, Jack, and is lying
down on the couch in the dining-room," replied
Mrs. Lovat.  "I do wish this time of dreadful
uncertainty was over.  It seems to be wearing
my life out."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to take part in the war,
mother," said Jack.  "I sometimes get tired
of the humdrum life we lead.  Why didn't dad
allow me to join the Scouts Mr. Driscoll raised
when the war broke out?  I can fight as well as
any man, and I know I can shoot straight."
</p>

<p>
"Jack!"
</p>

<p>
"I did not mean to hurt your feelings,
mother; but if any Boers come here to harm
you or Mary, they will have a bad time of it,
so long as I can stand on my feet or hold a
rifle."
</p>

<p>
Tears came into gentle Mrs. Lovat's eyes,
as she replied, "The war spirit is a dreadful
thing, Jack.  It seems a crime in this twentieth
century for men to be so anxious to imbrue
their hands in their fellow-creatures' blood.
I am always saying, 'Lord! how long?'"
</p>

<p>
"Well, all I can say, mother, is that if any
Boers try to take Kopje Farm, while I can
handle my rifle, they will stand a chance of
being winged for their pains," observed Jack.
"No Boers come here unless I am disabled
and can't stop them.  I am going now to tell
Pat to saddle up and give a look-out for dad;"
and saying this, he strode out of the apartment
and walked to where Pat was still standing
staring at the road leading to Springbokfontein.
</p>

<p>
"Pat!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sorr," answered the Irishman, coming
to attention; "I'm at your service, sorr."
</p>

<p>
"Put the saddle on Cawdor and gallop
down the road.  If you should happen to
meet father, you need not say that I sent
you.  You understand?"
</p>

<p>
"I know your meaning perfectly well, sorr,"
replied Pat; and the honest fellow walked
to the stables, where he saddled Cawdor, a
beautiful Arab, which Mr. Lovat had purchased
at Worcester a year before, while on his
ostrich-selling peregrinations.
</p>

<p>
Jack looked attentively at Pat's preparations.
The Irishman spent some time in examining
the saddlery, paying special attention to the
girths, and being apparently satisfied with his
inspection, he mounted.
</p>

<p>
"You have forgotten your rifle," said Jack.
"You had better take it with you."
</p>

<p>
"I've got a barker, sorr," observed Pat,
with a laugh, tapping his hip-pocket.  "An
officer of the ould corps gave it me many years
ago, an' we've not parted company yet."
</p>

<p>
"Wait here till I return," said Jack authoritatively;
and the settler's son went back to the
house.
</p>

<p>
Jack proceeded straight to a storeroom
where Mr. Lovat was in the habit of keeping
his rifles and ammunition.  He selected a
weapon of the Lee-Enfield pattern, and took
down a bandolier which was hanging on a peg.
The bandolier was empty, but Jack broke open
an ammunition box and filled the pockets of the
belt with cartridges, after which he returned
to Pat.
</p>

<p>
"Here, take these, Pat," said Jack, handing
up the rifle and bandolier, which the Irishman
took.  The latter slung the belt over his
shoulder, and, at Jack's suggestion, filled the
magazine of the rifle.
</p>

<p>
"Well, good-bye, sorr," said Pat, and the
next moment Cawdor was proceeding at a
canter down the mountain road.
</p>

<p>
An hour passed, still no signs of Mr. Lovat
or Pat, and Jack's anxiety increased.  The
ostrich farmer was a man of his word, and
Jack began to fear that something was wrong,
but he kept a cheerful face in front of his
mother and Mary.
</p>

<p>
They were sitting in the dining-room,
partaking of tea, when a tap was heard on the
half-open door.  Jack instantly rose to his
feet and went outside.  In the hall stood Pete.
The Kaffir did not speak, but beckoned with
his forefinger, and then passed through a door
leading to a back yard.
</p>

<p>
Jack followed, and when outside, said,
"Well, Pete, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Baas Jack," exclaimed Pete, "I dunno,
but something is wrong.  Come!" and the
native walked rapidly round to the front of
the house, Jack following in wonderment.
</p>

<p>
"Look, baas," said the Kaffir, "what does
that mean?" and he pointed to what appeared
to be a moving spot on the veldt.
</p>

<p>
Jack gazed long and earnestly.  "Why, it
is a horse without a rider!" he exclaimed at
last.
</p>

<p>
Kaffirs are noted for their keenness of
vision, and shading his eyes with his right
hand, Pete observed, "The horse is coming
dis way, Baas Jack."
</p>

<p>
Pete was right.  Nearer and nearer came
the flying quadruped, until at last the stirrups
from an empty saddle could be seen swaying
backwards and forwards.
</p>

<p>
Jack's breath came thick and fast.  The
horse in a mad gallop was approaching
them.
</p>

<p>
"Baas Jack," cried Pete, "it is Bessie!"
</p>

<p>
And so it proved.  A few moments later,
Mary's pet, the beautiful creature Mr. Lovat
had driven to Springbokfontein that morning
in the Cape cart, galloped up, covered with
foam and blood!
</p>

<p>
Bessie was trembling in every limb, but she
whinnied gently as Jack patted her neck.  On
Bessie's back was a Boer saddle.  A sudden
fear descended on Jack Lovat, and mentally
he asked the question, "What has happened
to father?"
</p>

<p>
The mare was bleeding from a wound in
the right shoulder, evidently caused by a
bullet.
</p>

<p>
"Take her round to the stables, Pete," said
Jack.  "I will join you presently."  Saying
this, he went into the house.  He met
Mrs. Lovat coming out of the dining-room, and she
at once accosted him.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter, Jack?  I heard the
noise of hoofs just now.  Is it your father who
has returned?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he has not come yet, mother," answered
Jack.  "You must finish your tea.  Pete wants
me round at the stables.  I shall be back
presently;" and he went out again, but
Mrs. Lovat followed him.
</p>

<p>
Pete was busily engaged in rubbing down
the mare, and when Mrs. Lovat caught a
glimpse of the blood on the poor creature's
hide, she cried out, "Why, Jack, it is Bessie!
Where is your father?" and the settler's wife
burst into a flood of tears.
</p>

<p>
"You are in the way just now, mother,"
said Jack gently.  "Go inside, until I have
seen to Bessie.  Something, I am afraid, has
happened.  The poor thing is in great pain,
and I must do what I can to relieve it.  Do
go inside, please, mother.  I will come to you
presently."'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lovat, whose vivid imagination had
conjured up all kinds of evils, obeyed Jack, and
returned to the house.
</p>

<p>
Now Jack Lovat's sterling qualities of
coolness and resource began to be displayed.
With the skill of an experienced veterinary
surgeon, he examined Bessie's wound, and
then carefully washed away the coagulated
blood.  A gaping orifice an inch in diameter
in the animal's shoulder told Jack that it was
a gunshot wound and that it had been caused
by a Mauser expanding bullet.
</p>

<p>
The "boys" had gathered round, all anxious
to help; but Jack would allow no other hands
than those of himself and Pete to touch the
mare, so the Kaffirs drew back, and stood
whispering among themselves.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a clattering noise was heard, and
before the "boys" could get out of the way,
Pat O'Neill, mounted on Cawdor, whose chest
and flanks were foam-flecked, was on the top
of them, sending Zacchary and Moses tumbling
to the ground.
</p>

<p>
The Irishman was bareheaded, and the
arteries in his temples stood out like
whipcord.  He pulled Cawdor up, and dismounted.
Jack, with wildly dilated eyes, queried,
"What is the matter, Pat?  Have you seen
father?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sorr," gasped the faithful Irishman,
"I haven't seen the master; but a Boer
commando&mdash;bad luck to them!&mdash;is making
straight for us.  And I'm afraid, sorr, it will
be a bad job for all of us.  Their scouts are
close at hand even now.  You'll fight, sorr?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we will all fight, Pat," answered
Jack proudly.  "Boys, all at once to the
storeroom.  Pete, take Bessie into the stable
and give her some water and a feed of corn.
I'm sorry for mother and Mary, but it can't be
helped.  No surrender to the Boers!"
</p>

<p>
And Jack Lovat, although only a lad, and
suffering under dire apprehension, began his
preparations for the defence of the Kopje
Farm.
</p>

<p>
His worthy henchman, Pat O'Neill, had
often detailed to him the story of the glorious
defence of Rorke's Drift, where a few
Britishers, many of whom were sick and
wounded, for hours, amid flames and death-dealing
bullets, had held at bay the flower
of savage Tshingwayo's command.
</p>

<p>
"Master Jack," said Pat, as Mr. Lovat's
son stopped for a moment in his work, "we
will hould the place for the sake of the missis
an' Miss Mary, an' please the Almighty, I
hope wid the same results as we had at the
Drift on the Buffalo River, when eight Victoria
Crosses were won in one night."
</p>

<p>
"We will hold it to the last, Pat," responded
Jack quietly.  "My father has had to work
hard for all he has, and the Boers shan't
take it from him while my finger can pull a
trigger;" and Jack Lovat meant every word
he said.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
A BOER LAAGER
</h3>

<p>
Eleven miles north-west of Orangefontein,
and an almost equal distance from Springbokfontein,
a party of Boers were laagered.  They
were Free Staters, with a sprinkling of
Hollanders and renegade Britons&mdash;the latter,
few in number, having at one time served
with the English colours, and owing to their
misdeeds, had deserted or been drummed out
of the British army.
</p>

<p>
Nearly all were in rags, for that ubiquitous
cavalry leader, General French, had not allowed
them a minute's rest, but had hurried and
harried them hither and thither, until the
majority of the burghers had grown sick and
tired of the guerilla warfare, and wished for
the end to come.
</p>

<p>
Their portable possessions&mdash;and indeed the
latter could not be otherwise than portable&mdash;were
stowed away in a few light Cape carts.
</p>

<p>
Ammunition was scarce, and had to be
husbanded with the greatest care, while food
could only be procured with much difficulty
from the scattered farmsteads among the
mountains of the Langeberg Range.
</p>

<p>
A Boer of immense stature, holding in his
right hand a formidable sjambok, was leaning
against the wheel of one of the carts.  He
was a magnificent specimen of physical
manhood, and the privations that for two long
years he had uncomplainingly endured had
only served to increase his tremendous muscular
strength.
</p>

<p>
His bronzed and deeply marked features
showed a strength of will and determination
rare even in that race of obstinate men, the
Boers of South Africa.
</p>

<p>
An immense beard swept his breast, the hair
composing it being streaked with gray.  When
Christian Uys first shouldered his rifle on the
outbreak of hostilities he was, comparatively
speaking, a young man, but under the sombre
folds of the flag of war he had grown
prematurely aged and gray.
</p>

<p>
A young burgher passing with a led horse,
with a limping gait, arrested his attention, and
awoke him from the train of gloomy reveries
he was indulging in.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Van Donnop," said the commandant,
"I wish to speak to you.  What is the matter
with your horse?"
</p>

<p>
The burgher whom he addressed was a
sprightly young fellow of nineteen, strongly
made, and as agile as the springbok he had
hunted from youth upwards.
</p>

<p>
"It is lame, Commandant," answered the
youth.  "One of its pasterns is split.  I do not
think it will be able to travel farther.  And
my favourite horse, too.  I am very sorry, for
it has been mine since it was a foal."
</p>

<p>
"I too am sorry, Piet," said the officer in a
sympathising tone of voice.  "We are greatly
in need of horses."
</p>

<p>
The commandant stooped down and
examined the horse's hoofs, after which he
looked up and remarked in a grave tone of
voice, "A bad case, Piet.  The poor brute must
be killed."
</p>

<p>
A crimson flush surged up into the face of
the young burgher, and he exclaimed excitedly,
"Do not ask me to kill her, Commandant!  She
was my mother's gift to me when I was sixteen.
I am hoping to leave her at my father's farm
and obtain another mount in her place."
</p>

<p>
A look of pity crept into the commandant's
face as he gazed at the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I forgot, Van Donnop," said the Boer
leader; "you are now in your native parts.
How long have you served in my commando?"
</p>

<p>
The young burgher thought for a moment,
and then answered, "From three months
before we beat the rooineks at Koorn Spruit,
near the Waterworks.  Let me see, that is now
going on for two years.  You will allow me
to keep the mare, Commandant?" Van Donnop
asked beseechingly.
</p>

<p>
"But how will you travel?" asked Uys.
</p>

<p>
"I am fleet of foot, and do not mind the
hardship," pleaded the lad.  "If I may only
keep my horse, I shall be happy.  She is part
of myself;" and Piet's voice faltered as he
went on, "She who gave me the mare is
dead."
</p>

<p>
Piet stroked the finely arched neck of the
mare, and the gentle creature rubbed its tawny
muzzle against the young burgher's cheek.
</p>

<p>
"We shall see," said the commandant at last.
"By the way, you and your brother Jan know
this countryside well.  If we are to reach
Port Nolloth, we must have more mounts.
Do you know any likely place where we can
replenish our stock of horses?"
</p>

<p>
"There is one farm where many horses are
kept&mdash;at least there used to be, when I was
at home."
</p>

<p>
"And where is that?" asked the commandant.
"To whom does the farm belong?"
</p>

<p>
"To a settler named Lovat," answered Piet.
</p>

<p>
"One of our race?" interrogated the commandant.
</p>

<p>
"He is opposed to us," replied Piet; "his
name is a foreign one.  He is a Scotch settler
who breeds many horses and ostriches."
</p>

<p>
"Has he helped the rooineks?" queried
Uys, and a frown passed over his face.
</p>

<p>
"He does not sympathise with us, Commandant,"
answered Piet, "but I do not think
he has favoured one side or the other.  I
believe he is entirely taken up with looking
after his ostriches."
</p>

<p>
"And you can guide us to this farm?"
asked the commandant.  "Possibly he may
have some spare nags."
</p>

<p>
Piet Van Donnop evidently did not like the
suggested commission, and the commandant,
noting this, went on: "We must have some
mounts, Piet, or the rooineks will catch us.  If
that happens, I'm afraid our fate will be a sorry
one.  A regiment of Lancers&mdash;the men who
cut up the Transvaalers at Elandslaagte&mdash;as
well as several troops of New Zealanders are
on our track, and without fresh horses we
shall stand an almost sure chance of capture."
</p>

<p>
"You will not harm Mr. Lovat or his
family?" asked Piet.
</p>

<p>
A smile played for a moment on the commandant's
stern features, then he said, "Not
at all, Piet.  Why should we?  I'm afraid your
heart is concerned in the matter.  But of
course we must have what we require, and
very few questions asked into the bargain."
</p>

<p>
"I will guide you, then," said the young
burgher.  "I may keep my horse, Commandant?"
</p>

<p>
"We shall see in the morning, boy," was
the only reply vouchsafed by the Boer leader;
and Piet moved on, leading his lame horse.
</p>

<p>
Taking out an immense pipe from one of
his pockets, Christian Uys filled it with leaf
tobacco, lit up, and began to smoke.
</p>

<p>
The commandant was evidently in a tender
mood, for his thoughts were in distant Winburg,
where his wife and the children left to him
were being sheltered in a concentration camp,
created by his arch-enemies, the British.
</p>

<p>
His was a strange compound of human
nature.  At times generous and kind, at
others he was fierce, implacable, and relentless.
Like his famous leader, General Joubert,
at the outset he had realised that the struggle
in which his country had engaged was a hopeless
one, but with the obstinacy characteristic
of his race, when once his hand was put to
the plough, there was no turning back.
</p>

<p>
Christian Uys had already lost three sons
in the war.  His youngest, a boy of fifteen,
and the flower of the commandant's family,
had been shot in the stomach at Senekal.
The brave boy hid his wound and continued
on the march, although a trail of blood
marked the path along which he rode, until
he fell exhausted from his saddle, and with
his dying breath, and a look of intense love
in his eyes, said, "Father, I can fight no more,
I am done."  These were the brave lad's last
words, and like others on both sides, yielded
up his spirit for the cause in which he thought
he was righteously fighting.
</p>

<p>
An older brother had been with the fierce
Cronje in the honeycombed banks of the
Modder, amidst the brown sulphurous smoke
of bursting lyddite shells, and while bringing
water for a wounded comrade from the polluted
stream, had been struck squarely in the chest
by a Lee-Enfield bullet, and had fallen on his
face, never to rise again.
</p>

<p>
The last to die was the oldest boy of the
family.  A delicate youth at the best, he had
gone on commando with his father when the
vierkeleur was first hoisted in the field.  For
several months he had fought and roughed it
with the rest, until foul enteric seized him, and
the ranks of the Boer army knew him no more.
He found a last resting-place in a shallow grave
on the veldt, not many miles from his birthplace.
</p>

<p>
Christian Uys woke up from his reverie
and took a stroll round the laager.  Here
was Jan Steen, once a well-to-do jeweller of
Winburg, who before war broke out was
always immaculately dressed, with ample
starched shirt front and bejewelled fingers;
there Van Sterck, the learned medico of the
same town.  Neither had had a change of
raiment for months, and both looked
correspondingly miserable.  Yonder stood Louis
Bredon, the dandy of Harrismith, now a
veritable scarecrow in trousers made of
sacking on which the address of a large
milling concern in Johannesburg was branded
in staring black letters.  Bredon, like the rest
of the commando, was weary of the daily
trekking, discomfort, and misery incidental to
warfare, and his mind was wandering back
to the time when he used to walk down the
shady side of Harrismith's main street, the
cynosure of the belles of the Free State town.
</p>

<p>
"You look discontented, Bredon," said Uys.
"I am afraid you are like most of my burghers.
We cannot give in now, after we have endured
so much.  There has not been sufficient fighting
of late to keep up your martial spirit.  We
want horses, Bredon, and they must be obtained,
if we are to reach Port Nolloth.  Otherwise
we had better surrender."
</p>

<p>
"I have no objection, Commandant," replied
Bredon somewhat brusquely.  "I've had enough
of the war.  We ought never to have been
drawn into it."
</p>

<p>
"You speak like a patriot," observed Uys
sarcastically.  "I undergo the same hardships
as other burghers.  You have suffered nothing
as yet.  In what respect have you endured
more than the rest of us?"
</p>

<p>
Bredon hung down his head in a sheepish
manner and remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"I am finding a cure for your melancholy
and dissatisfaction, Bredon.  I am detaching a
portion of the commando for the duty of
securing a fresh supply of horses.  Van
Donnop is acting as guide to the farmstead
of a settler named Lovat.  You will form
one of the commandeering party;" and Uys
passed on.
</p>

<p>
"To think," muttered the commandant,
"fellows such as Bredon were the most eager
at the outset, and now they begin to whine
when a little hardship has to be borne!  My
poor Christian, Louis, and Wilhelm were
formed of different stuff."
</p>

<p>
Christian Uys came up to a man who was
busily engaged in cleaning his Mauser.  The
burgher laid down his rifle as the commandant
approached.
</p>

<p>
"Eloff," began Uys, "I want you to pick
a dozen good men of the commando.  Before
morning I must have half a score of horses.
Piet Van Donnop knows a farm where they
can be obtained, and will guide you to it."
</p>

<p>
Paul Eloff was a man built in the same
herculean mould as his leader, Christian Uys,
and he looked at the commandant keenly.
</p>

<p>
"We shall want more, Commandant," said
Eloff; "a dozen will scarcely suffice.  Let me
see," and the Boer began counting rapidly
on his fingers, after which he added, "Yes,
quite a dozen, Commandant.  The spare led
horses were taken as mounts yesterday.  We
must reach Port Nolloth, or we shall be cut
off by the rooineks."
</p>

<p>
"You will muster the burghers, then, Eloff,"
said Uys.  "Bring them round to the
commissariat waggon within half an hour, and
do not forget Van Donnop.  Although a boy,
his heart is good."
</p>

<p>
"I will not fail, Commandant," replied Eloff,
picking up his rifle and recommencing the
cleansing process.
</p>

<p>
In less than the stipulated time, Eloff with
his picked burghers stood before the
commandant, each man at his horse's head.
</p>

<p>
Christian Uys called Eloff aside and
whispered, "Do you think you are sufficiently
strong for the purpose in hand?"
</p>

<p>
"I should make the patrol fifty strong,
Commandant," answered Eloff.  "You are
remaining in laager, I suppose, until we
return?"
</p>

<p>
"That is my intention, Eloff," answered Uys.
"Van Donnop informed me that the Kopje
Farm&mdash;this Scotch settler's residence&mdash;is some
eight miles from here.  You will keep a sharp
look-out for the rooineks, Eloff, and not be
caught napping?"
</p>

<p>
A smile spread over Eloff's face as he
answered, "When I am found asleep, Commandant,
I shall not return to tell the tale.
We have got to the end of our tether, and
I am longing to have one more go at the
rooineks.  After that, well&mdash;oblivion."
</p>

<p>
"It is a bad cause we have started on, Eloff,"
said Uys.  "It is as General Joubert foretold
at the beginning, we are fighting in a lost
cause.  How can we hope to stand against a
mighty Power like England, which has millions
of gold and men without number?  Bah! we
were a race of fools to be led by the nose.
President Kruger, who commenced the war,
basely deserted us.  But I must not speak of
this.  It is horses we want, and horses we
must have."
</p>

<p>
Paul Eloff quickly mustered the additional
burghers required, and in sections of fours the
motley cavalcade trekked towards the Kopje
Farm.
</p>

<p>
Eloff and Van Donnop rode at the head of
the slender force, and the former turning to
the young Dutchman, said, "This is a rough
country, Van Donnop.  You spent most of your
life here?"
</p>

<p>
"Until I went on commando," answered Piet.
"I shall be glad when I can get back to my
father's farm.  Those were happy days, Eloff."
</p>

<p>
"You know the farmstead whither we are
bound," inquired Eloff, "and the people as
well, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly," answered Piet.
</p>

<p>
"And what about the owner?  Is he a
fighting man?  Shall we have much trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Lovat is quiet enough," replied Piet.
"He has a son named Jack, a dare-devil sort
of boy, who will show fight, I think, but
possibly he may be on commando with the
rooineks."
</p>

<p>
"Any Kaffirs kept on the farm?" queried
Eloff.
</p>

<p>
"There used to be many," answered Van
Donnop.  "I do not wish any harshness to be
used towards Mr. Lovat.  He used to be very
kind to me before I went on commando.  The
horses will be paid for, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
Eloff laughed outright as he replied, "Van
Donnop, I don't think a single gold piece
can be found in the pockets of the whole
commando.  My instructions are to take what
we require&mdash;as civilly, of course, as possible.
The account will be paid when the vierkeleur
flies not over the Transvaal and Orange Free
State only, but over the whole of the Cape.  A
receipt for the horses, of course, will be given."
</p>

<p>
The Boers, who had been travelling through
a series of dongas, now debouched into a fairly
open country.
</p>

<p>
Eloff halted his men, and after looking
ahead, turned to Van Donnop.
</p>

<p>
"You have a pair of field glasses, Van
Donnop, allow me to look through them."
</p>

<p>
Piet handed the glasses to Eloff, who placed
them to his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"There is a farmhouse, Van Donnop, on a
kopje some four miles ahead," said Eloff; "is
it the home of this Mr. Lovat?"
</p>

<p>
"That is where Mr. Lovat used to live,"
replied Piet; "things have changed much
lately."
</p>

<p>
"A big place for a farmstead," observed
Eloff.  "This Mr. Lovat must be rich."
</p>

<p>
"He is said to be fairly wealthy," answered
Piet.  "He was a nobleman in his own country,
so I have heard it said."
</p>

<p>
"And the house lower down the valley,
to whom does that belong?" queried Eloff.
"Take the glasses, Van Donnop, then you will
see what I mean.  Over there;" and the Boer
pointed with his index finger in a certain
direction.
</p>

<p>
"That is Jagger's Farm," said Piet, after a
glance through the glasses.  "No horses can
be obtained there.  The farm has not been
occupied for years."
</p>

<p>
"We will march straight on the place,
Van Donnop, rest a while, and then move
on to&mdash;what is the name of the place,
Piet?"
</p>

<p>
"The Kopje Farm," replied the young
Dutchman.  "Someone is driving a Cape cart
towards Jagger's Farm, Eloff."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, Van Donnop.  Give me
the glasses again," said Eloff.
</p>

<p>
Eloff peered through the instrument for a
moment, after which he ordered half a dozen
burghers to gallop rapidly towards Jagger's
Farm, in order to intercept the solitary
passenger in the Cape cart, while he and his
remaining fellow-countrymen dismounted and
awaited events.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
FRINGED WITH FIRE
</h3>

<p>
Kopje was singularly well situated for
defence.  From the rising ground behind the
house, no attack could be made by mounted
men, as it was strewn with big boulders of
rock, and interlaced with dongas, which though
not deep, presented insuperable difficulties to
an enemy manoeuvring on horseback.
</p>

<p>
The ostrich kraals&mdash;which were in reality
one long rambling building&mdash;commanded the
country from which the only attack by mounted
men could be made, and the ground in front
was open.
</p>

<p>
On receipt of Pat's intelligence, Jack went
to his mother and told her the news brought
by the Irishman.  He insisted upon her as well
as Mary remaining inside the house, and would
not listen to her suggestion that if the Boers
were really advancing upon the farmstead, they
should be allowed to take whatever they pleased,
on condition they harmed none of its inmates.
</p>

<p>
"No, mother," said Jack firmly; "I have
always been obedient, but any Boer who dares
to enter Kopje Farm without an invitation
from me will have a bullet from my rifle
through him before he can say 'Jack
Robinson'!  Please say no more, mother.
Father is not here, and may be dead, but if he
is all right I could never look him in the face
again if I did not show fight.  Stay inside
with Mary, and do not venture out until I
come for you.  I must go to the 'boys' now, as
time is precious;" and saying this, Jack went
across to the ostrich kraal, where the Kaffir
servants were assembled.
</p>

<p>
The sun was within half an hour of setting,
and the light was good enough to enable our
hero&mdash;for such Jack Lovat will prove to be
before we bid him adieu&mdash;to distinguish a
body of horsemen moving in an oblique
direction across the veldt.  Pat had stabled
Cawdor, and stood awaiting orders from Jack.
</p>

<p>
"We must have the rifles and ammunition
from the storeroom, Pat," said Jack, "and
quick must be the word.  Kindly look after
the boys, Pat.  Zacchary, Pete, and the lot
of you, go and bring the rifles; and don't
forget, Pete, to bring a hammer.  One moment,
Pat; a couple of lanterns will be needed, as
well as some matches."
</p>

<p>
Strange it is that fighting blood is transmitted
from generation to generation, but so it
proved in Jack Lovat's case.  An ancestor of
his had suffered death on Culloden field for
what he considered his duty towards the
unfortunate race of Stuarts, and Jack was
prepared to lay down his life in the defence of
the Kopje Farm.
</p>

<p>
In the excitement of the moment he forgot
about his father's possible peril.  His thoughts
were concentrated on the question, "Can I
strike a blow for the honour of the old
country?"  Jack had not gone through a
course of metaphysics or logic.  He was
simply a lad, made a man before his time
perhaps, and yearning for an outlet through
which a vast flood of pent-up patriotism could
be poured.
</p>

<p>
Pat and the "boys," in almost less time than
it takes to relate, transferred the arms to the
ostrich kraal.  The weapons were in splendid
order.  Jack Lovat had seen to that.  Many
hours he had spent in cleaning the rifles,
always hoping, boylike, that some day they
would come in handy, when the Boers put in
an appearance.
</p>

<p>
The ungainly-looking ostriches, penned in
spaces of rectangular form, craned their
far-stretching necks, all the while uttering the
grunt peculiar to the birds, dubbed by
naturalists <i>Struthio Camelus</i>.
</p>

<p>
A passage, four feet in width, ran between
the inner walls of the kraal and the high
hurdles forming the temporary home of the
ostriches.  Four feet above the flagged floor
of the kraal were loopholes, and these presently
had the barrels of rifles protruding from them.
</p>

<p>
A couple of thousand rounds of ammunition,
in boxes holding one hundred each, were
placed in handy positions, and Pete with
much dexterity knocked off the lids of the
boxes, thus exposing the little nickel-plated
messengers of death.
</p>

<p>
Each "boy" was given a rifle, and by the
way the magazines were charged it was evident
that the weapons had been handled before.
</p>

<p>
Pat, who was peering through a loophole,
cried out, "The beggars are coming, sorr, an'
they're more than fifty strong."
</p>

<p>
Jack, who was engaged in inspecting the
"boys'" rifles, at once went up to Pat.
</p>

<p>
"How far off do you make them now,
Pat?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Bedad! they seem to be only five hundred
yards away," answered the Irishman.  But Pat
was wrong in his conjecture, and Pete at once
corrected him.
</p>

<p>
"Dey be quite a mile from de farm, Baas
Jack," said the Kaffir.  "De eyes ob white
men do not see right&mdash;at least not in dis
country."
</p>

<p>
A peep through a loophole told Jack that
Pete's estimate was a correct one.  The South
African atmosphere is so clear that distance
seems annihilated on the veldt.
</p>

<p>
Jack addressed a few words to the defenders
of the farm.  "Boys," he began, "before long
we may be in a tight hole.  I am going to run
the show for what it is worth.  It shall never
be said that Christian Uys and his men took
Kopje Farm without a shot being fired.  You
boys, of course, know what it will mean if any
of you are captured with arms in your hands.
A sjambokking first, and possibly after that a
Mauser bullet through the head.  We must
have no white-flag business here.  If any of
you boys don't care to fight, there is time for
you to get away over the kopje.  Pat and I
mean to stay here till the last."
</p>

<p>
"We stay with the baas as well," said Pete
emphatically; and in Kaffir fashion the whole
of the "boys" held up their right hands,
extending the index finger in a significant
manner.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," returned Jack.  "And now to
business!"
</p>

<p>
The eyes of the Kaffirs were fixed on
something behind Jack, and the latter noting this,
turned quickly round.  To his great surprise,
his eyes fell upon the figures of his mother
and Mary.
</p>

<p>
"This is no place for you, mother," said
Jack.  "You must return to the house.  It is
quite safe there."
</p>

<p>
"But what does this mean, Jack?" asked
Mrs. Lovat, pointing to the ammunition boxes
and rifles.  "This will be death to someone.
My dear boy, pray do be careful."
</p>

<p>
"All right, mother," said Jack, with a laugh.
"I'll be more than careful.  But you must go
back to the house.  You will only be in the
way here."
</p>

<p>
"I am almost distracted, Jack.  Your father
may be dead;" and Mrs. Lovat broke into a
paroxysm of tears.  "This cruel war is killing
me.  Why cannot things be settled without
recourse to bloodshed?"
</p>

<p>
Had Mrs. Lovat passed through the same
experiences as many settlers' wives in Natal
and the northern parts of Cape Colony, the
exclamation might have been a justifiable one.
As it was, the black wings of Azrael, the Angel
of Death, were beginning to flap over the
Kopje Farm, and the ostrich farmer's wife,
whose nature was a curious compound of
kindness, fear, credulity, and misgiving, began
to show signs of fainting.
</p>

<p>
Not so Mary Lovat.  Although only a girl
in her early teens, she possessed a large share
of her brother Jack's mental and moral courage,
and she came up and whispered in Jack's ear,
"Mother will go back to the house with me,
but I should so much like to stay here."
</p>

<p>
Pat O'Neill ended Mary's whispering somewhat
abruptly, but quietly.  He had been
patrolling the rough ground outside the Kopje
Farm, and coming inside the walled enclosure,
walked swiftly up to Jack.
</p>

<p>
"The Boers are near at hand, sorr," he
whispered.  "What is the missis doing here?
This is no place for ladies.  Shall I take them
across to the house?"
</p>

<p>
The next moment, Mrs. Lovat and Mary,
escorted by Pat and Moses, were passing
under the shelter of the dry stone wall to the
farmhouse, and Moses, who had his rifle and
a supply of ammunition with him, was told to
stay with the "missis" until he was sent for.
</p>

<p>
Having seen the two ladies seated in the
dining-room, with Moses acting as their guard,
Pat returned at breakneck speed to the kraal,
where he found Jack examining the approaching
horsemen attentively through a pair of
field glasses.
</p>

<p>
The twilight of South Africa is of short
duration, but the light was still good.
</p>

<p>
"They are Boers," said Jack, handing the
glasses to his faithful henchman.  "Just give a
look, Pat, and tell me, if you can, how many
there are, and what distance they are now from
the farm."
</p>

<p>
Pat placed the binocular to his optics and
gazed for a moment down the valley, after
which he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, sorr; they're Boers sure
enough, and well within half a mile av us.
About fifty or more, I should say, sorr, an' a
big fellow in front is houlding a white flag.
You saw the chap, sorr, the man on the gray
horse.  Now they have halted, and, bedad, the
man is coming forrard.  See for yourself,
sorr;" and the worthy Irishman handed back
the glasses to his young master.
</p>

<p>
It took but a moment to convince Jack that
Pat was right, and that a Boer was approaching
under a flag of truce.
</p>

<p>
"Inside at once, Pat!" our hero cried; and
the pair entered the kraal.
</p>

<p>
"Man the loopholes, boys!" said Jack; and
the Kaffirs, whose rifle magazines were charged,
stood to their posts.  Nine murderous-looking
small-bore rifles were instantly pointed down
the valley.
</p>

<p>
The man on the gray horse had halted a
couple of hundred paces in front of the party
of horsemen, as though undecided what to do.
</p>

<p>
"I'll interview him, sorr," said Pat, whose
place was next to Jack Lovat.  "I'll go and
see what the rascal wants."
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking about the same thing
myself," observed Jack.  "Maybe it will be the
best thing that can be done.  No, you must
not take your rifle; and put that bandolier off,
Pat."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sorr.  I'm anyhow for an aisy
life.  An' conscience," replied the brave
Irishman, "I've got the barker, sorr, if things
come to the worst.  Then I can go, Master
Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Pat; just slip down and see what
the thieving rascals want.  But remember, we
have no remounts at Kopje Farm for them."
</p>

<p>
"I understand, sorr," said Pat; and the
ex-soldier walked boldly out of the kraal to the
spot where the individual on the gray horse
had halted.
</p>

<p>
Pat, whose stride was none of the shortest,
made rapid tracks towards the solitary horseman,
whose left hand grasped a short stick
to the end of which was attached a white
handkerchief, while the right supported the
barrel of a Mauser rifle, the butt end of which
rested on his thigh.
</p>

<p>
"Halt!" cried the horseman in perfect
English, as Pat came up.  "Who and what are
you?"
</p>

<p>
"That is my business," answered Pat.  "I
will put a more pertinent question to you.
Long-whiskers! who an' what are you, an'
what do you mane by disturbing honest folk
in these lonely parts?"
</p>

<p>
"Have you any horses at the farmstead just
ahead?" asked the stranger.  "This is a part
of Christian Uys's commando, and we want a
few Boer ponies badly."
</p>

<p>
"You said Boer ponies?" said Pat interrogatively.
</p>

<p>
"I spoke plainly enough, I think," answered
the Boer.  "We are in need of a few horses,
which the British Government will pay for.
We will give a receipt for them."
</p>

<p>
"The master has some grand nags," said
Pat, "but av course he will want payment for
them.  Can you pay on the nail?"
</p>

<p>
The Boer, who was not by any means a bad-looking
man of about fifty, laughed outright at
Pat's <i>insouciance</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Irishman went on: "Will the paper
hould good if the master lets you have
them?"
</p>

<p>
"When the vierkeleur flies over the whole of
South Africa, your master will be paid in good
gold, and that will be before many months are
over," replied the Boer.
</p>

<p>
"And if the master does not care to part
with the animals?" inquired Pat.
</p>

<p>
"We'll take them, of course," replied the
Boer.  "We are tired of bloodshed, but we have
won the day; the rooineks can't deny that fact.
You see the burghers behind me?  Well, we
are some of the fellows who cut up your crack
regiments at Sanna's Post."
</p>

<p>
"Then I may return an' tell the master that
you'll pay for the nags?" asked Pat.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, but don't be long about it,"
replied the Boer; "and tell your employer's
son&mdash;for the master of the house is not at
home, and won't be to-night&mdash;that any attempt
at double-dealing will be harshly dealt with.
Within ten minutes from now we will advance
upon the farm, and if necessary, take by force
all we require."
</p>

<p>
Pat needed no further telling, but strolled
back to the farmstead, wondering all the time
whether a Boer bullet would lay him flat on
the veldt or not.
</p>

<p>
The orange tints glimmering above the
mountains were beginning to fade into a light
purplish gray as Pat walked into the ostrich
kraal.
</p>

<p>
Jack, naturally enough, was awaiting his
return with some anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"They are Boers, Pat?" queried Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Boers, sure enough," responded Pat, "an'
they've come to commandeer the horses.  The
chap wid the white flag says they will pay for
them when the Boer flag waves over this
heathen part av the world."
</p>

<p>
"That is enough for me," said Jack, after he
had listened to Pat's brief narration.  "We
will wait until we see them on the move
towards us.  After that, they can look to
themselves."
</p>

<p>
The minutes seemed long, but at last,
through the dim twilight, the Boer on the gray
horse was seen waving his flag, as though
beckoning his fellow-burghers to advance.
</p>

<p>
On seeing this, Jack Lovat elevated his
rifle, pulled the trigger, and the bullet went
whistling high over the heads of the Boers.
</p>

<p>
The commando instantly halted, and the
advanced Boer rode quickly back to his
comrades.
</p>

<p>
The burghers opened out in wide formation,
and dismounting, poured in a volley.  The
majority of the bullets splashed against the
rough stones forming the wall of the ostrich
kraal.
</p>

<p>
"Now, boys," cried Jack, "that is just what
I wanted.  Take a careful, steady aim.  Don't
fire too wildly, and let every one select his man.
There is yet enough light to see them by.
Take the word from me."
</p>

<p>
Instantly the muzzles of nine rifles peeped
through as many loopholes, and Jack gave the
word, "Fire!"
</p>

<p>
The reports rang out as one, and the
defenders of the farm could see that some of
their shots had taken effect, for a couple of
Boer horses broke loose, and with clattering
hoofs came galloping towards the ostrich kraal.
A desultory fire came from the Boers, but as
yet no bullets had entered the loopholes.
</p>

<p>
"Empty your magazines," cried Jack, "but
wait for my orders.  Now, boys, one, two,
three," and at each successive number a tiny
horizontal sheet of flame shot from the
loopholes.
</p>

<p>
Yells of rage could be heard from the Boers,
mingled with groans, after which the sounds of
galloping hoofs were borne on the night air,
followed by complete silence.
</p>

<p>
It was now quite dark, and after waiting, it
must be said somewhat anxiously for several
minutes for a renewal of the attack, Jack
ordered Pat to light the lanterns, and the
Irishman instantly obeyed, and showed himself
an adept at the work.
</p>

<p>
Carefully shading the lighted match, so that
no stray rays of light could creep through the
loopholes, Pat lit the lanterns, when the
whinnying of horses outside attracted Jack's
attention.
</p>

<p>
"Remain here, Pat," said Jack.  "I'm going
across to the house, to give a look to my
mother and sister.  Keep a sharp look-out
while I am gone, in case the beggars come
back."
</p>

<p>
Saying this, Jack walked out into the
darkness, and the next moment stumbled
against a horse.  He, however, walked swiftly
towards the house, and found Moses, rifle in
hand, guarding the hall.  Jack had taken the
precaution of shouting out as he approached,
for he by no means relished the idea of a bullet
being planted between his ribs.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lovat and Mary were still in the
dining-room, and as Jack entered, the former
exclaimed, "What is the meaning of all this
firing, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"It means, mother, that if there had been
no firing, the Boers would before now have
emptied our stables.  We have beaten them
off, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Has anyone been hurt?" inquired Mrs. Lovat
nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Not on our side, mother," replied Jack,
with a laugh; "as far as the Boers are
concerned, I do not know.  If any harm has
happened to father, then I hope we have
killed the lot of them.  Moses is still on guard,
mother; you need have no fear.  I shall be
back presently;" and he walked out of the
room.
</p>

<p>
Moses, whose white teeth gleamed as Jack
passed him, said, "Dings are all right, Baas
Jack.  I will see dat no Boers come in here
to frighten de missis an' de little missie."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, Moses," observed Jack cheerfully.
"Give the beggars beans if they come."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do dat, baas," replied the grinning
Kaffir.
</p>

<p>
An hour later the moon, which was on the
wane, would creep over the kopje, and give
the defenders of the farm a chance to locate
their now unseen assailants.
</p>

<p>
A deep silence hung over the place, and
Jack groped his way along the wall leading to
the ostrich kraal.  Pat evidently knew his
work, for the place was in darkness.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a challenge rang out: "Is that you,
sorr?"
</p>

<p>
The speaker was Pat, whom Jack found
outside the kraal, holding a couple of horses.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Pat," answered Jack.  "The Boers
seem to have departed."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll take these nags inside, sorr, an'
have a look at them.  The poor things are
trembling all over their bodies down to their
fetlocks."
</p>

<p>
Jack entered the kraal, followed by Pat,
dragging the dumb brutes behind him.
</p>

<p>
"A light here, Pete," said Jack; and the
Kaffir foreman brought a shielded lantern.
Jack turned on the light, and by its aid
examined the horses.
</p>

<p>
By the saddlery on the animals, he came to
the conclusion that the horses had a couple of
hours before formed part of the equipment
of Christian Uys's commando, and a patch of
clotted blood on the saddle and off stirrup of
one of the horses told its own tale.
</p>

<p>
"Bring the light a little closer, Pat.  I want
to see the&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat never finished the sentence, for a
fierce fusillade was directed at the kraal from
the immediate outside, and Zacchary, who was
standing leaning on the butt of his rifle with
his head on a level with a porthole, tumbled
over&mdash;never to rise again, for a Mauser bullet
had found its billet in the unfortunate Kaffir's
head.
</p>

<p>
"To the loopholes, boys!" cried Jack; and
the defenders replied with a will to the fire of
the unseen enemy.  For half an hour a constant
fusillade was kept up, but without further
loss to the defenders of the kraal, after which
the Boer fire ceased.
</p>

<p>
Their attempt to storm the kraal had failed.
Very tenderly Jack Lovat and Pat carried the
stricken Zacchary to a corner of the kraal, and
covered the dead body with some empty mealie
sacks, after which Jack paid another visit to
the house, where he found his mother and
Mary quite safe.
</p>

<p>
A couple of hours were spent by Jack and
Pat in reconnoitring, but all traces of the Boers
had vanished, with the exception of a dead
horse, which evidently had been wounded and
managed to crawl towards the farm, where it
had dropped down and died.
</p>

<p>
About two o'clock in the morning a sheet of
flame, accompanied by the reports of many
rifles, was seen far down the valley.
</p>

<p>
"They have come up with some Britishers,
Pat," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"By the powers!" observed the Irishman,
"they seem to be hard at work.  I would give
something to be there."
</p>

<p>
For some minutes the firing lasted, then
ceased, and shortly afterwards the sound of
horses' hoofs could be heard coming up the
valley.
</p>

<p>
Jack and his followers instantly manned the
loopholes, but the strangers came steadily on.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I challenge them, sorr?" asked Pat;
and without waiting for a reply, the brave
Irishman passed out of the kraal, and with
a stentorian voice called out, "Halt! who
comes there?" at the same time levelling his
rifle at the approaching figures.
</p>

<p>
"It is I, Pat!" shouted the master of the
Kopje Farm; and the next moment Mr. Lovat
had Jack in his arms, exclaiming, "It was a
near shave, Jack, but I am glad I am able to
see you all once more."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lovat and Mary were delighted beyond
measure at Mr. Lovat's return, and with much
trembling listened to the account of his
adventures since he left the Kopje Farm on the
previous morning.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
MR. LOVAT'S ADVENTURE
</h3>

<p>
Little did Mr. Lovat dream of the
adventures he would pass through that morning
as he drove away from Kopje Farm in the
direction of Springbokfontein.  Bessie was in
good condition, and trotted swiftly between the
shafts of the Cape cart, and the crisp air
exhilarated man and beast.
</p>

<p>
When a couple of miles from home, he
met an acquaintance riding a Cape pony, and
pulled up to pass the time of day.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Bassett," said the ostrich
farmer, "any news of the Boers?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bassett&mdash;a sturdy, thick-set man of
middle age, who during his lifetime had tried his
hand at nearly every kind of occupation, and
now combined the office of land valuer with
that of gold prospector&mdash;replied, "I've just come
from Springbokfontein, Mr. Lovat, and rumours
are flying thick and fast about Christian Uys
being in the neighbourhood with a commando.
This Uys is a very daring fellow, and has
proved himself to be a most capable leader.
Their stock of horses, I suppose, is getting
low, and naturally enough the Boers want
to replenish their store."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," observed Mr. Lovat.  "I
suppose the town guard at Springbokfontein
are on the alert?"
</p>

<p>
"Not half of them are to be trusted," replied
Mr. Bassett grimly, "for I am afraid several of
them are rebels at heart.  You have left things
all right up at the Kopje Farm, I hope?"
</p>

<p>
"Any Boers calling there will get a warm
reception, I can assure you," replied Mr. Lovat,
with a laugh.  "I think that my son and the
'boys' will be able to give a good account of
themselves, if they are interfered with.  But I
must be getting along, as I wish to be back by
noon.  Good-morning, Mr. Bassett;" and the
ostrich farmer flicked Bessie with his whip.
</p>

<p>
The mare darted forward with a quick
motion, and in a short time Mr. Lovat came to
Jagger's Farm, the ruined building half way
between the Kopje Farm and Springbokfontein.
</p>

<p>
The country was wild in the extreme.  The
road ran between a range of kopjes, at the
bases of which were watercourses, dry in
summer, but at times during the winter months
raging torrents.
</p>

<p>
Jagger's Farm had an unenviable notoriety,
several white men having been murdered in
its vicinity.  The building was surrounded
by a roughly-built stone wall, which in many
places was in a state of ruin.
</p>

<p>
The roadway was strewn with boulders of
rock, and Mr. Lovat had to descend from his
perch in the cart for the purpose of leading
Bessie along the stony roadway.
</p>

<p>
The ostrich farmer was holding Bessie's
head, for the mare made a stumble, when a
harsh voice called out in Dutch, "Halt!"
</p>

<p>
To Mr. Lovat's dismay, he perceived six
unkempt and fierce-looking men with heads and
shoulders appearing above the farm wall, and
the more ominous sight of a row of rifles
pointed at him.
</p>

<p>
A couple of the Boers, for such they were,
leaped over the wall and ran towards Mr. Lovat.
The latter halted.  The nature of the road
and the murderous-looking Mausers dispelled
any idea of escape, so grasping Bessie's reins
tightly with his left hand, he faced the
strangers, and said, "What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"Your mare," answered one of the Boers in
English.
</p>

<p>
"I won't sell her," said Mr. Lovat decisively.
"She is not to be bought at any price.  Allow
me to pass, please."
</p>

<p>
A loud laugh burst from the Boers, the
remaining three having joined their fellows in
the roadway.
</p>

<p>
"Commandant Christian Uys requires the
service of your horse.  You will receive
payment for it when the war is over," was the
response Mr. Lovat received.
</p>

<p>
A couple of Boers sprang to the mare's head,
evidently with the intention of unharnessing
Bessie.
</p>

<p>
Grasping the handle of his whip, Mr. Lovat
brought the butt end down with force upon the
head of the Boer who had just spoken, and the
Dutchman stumbled and fell in the roadway.
</p>

<p>
The next moment the ostrich farmer was
lying senseless on the ground, having been
knocked down by a blow from a clubbed
rifle.
</p>

<p>
First came a vision of many-coloured stars,
then oblivion; and the world for the time
being was a blank to Mr. Lovat.
</p>

<p>
When he came to his senses, he found
himself lying in the farmyard.  His arms and
wrists had been securely fastened behind his
back, while his ankles were also tied.  The
Cape cart was standing close to where he lay,
but the mare was gone.
</p>

<p>
Then his thoughts turned to the bag of gold,
and though dazed and suffering from a violent
headache, a remembrance of his encounter
with the Boers flashed through his mind, and
he gave vent to a heavy groan.
</p>

<p>
The farmyard was covered with rough veldt
grass, which made his couch a less painful one
than it would have otherwise been.  A bundle
of dirty, discarded Boer clothing lay beside
him, and in the vehicle was a roughly made
hamper, which was not there when he left home.
</p>

<p>
He thought about his wife, Mary, and Jack,
and imagined their anxiety at his non-return.
He tried to move, but was unable to do so,
while the pain in his head was almost
insufferable.
</p>

<p>
The sun climbed higher in the heavens, and
its fierce rays beat upon his bare head.  His
physical pain grew greater, but the acuteness
of his mind-suffering lessened, and at last he
again relapsed into unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Lovat was brought to himself by
some one shaking him.
</p>

<p>
The ostrich farmer looked up in a dazed sort
of way, and the sight of a bronzed and stalwart
Colonial trooper clad in khaki, and wearing a
couple of bandoliers, met his gaze.
</p>

<p>
"What is the meaning of this?" asked the
trooper.  "Ah!  I see you are wounded.  You
are a Britisher, of course?"
</p>

<p>
In a few words, Mr. Lovat told the story of
his capture, and the Colonial drawing out a
clasp knife, cut the cords with which
Mr. Lovat's arms and ankles were bound, after
which the Irregular helped the farmer to his
feet.
</p>

<p>
A little pool of semi-coagulated blood lay
where his head had rested, and the trooper
noticing the settler's pallid face, drew out a
small flask containing brandy, and insisted on
his taking a drink.  The spirit revived
Mr. Lovat, and he made a search for the bag
containing the gold, but, alas! it too was gone.
</p>

<p>
While he was engaged in ruefully surveying
the cart, the trooper was joined by half a dozen
comrades, who had been busy searching the
farm premises.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Morton!" said one of the troopers,
addressing the Irregular who had released
Mr. Lovat.  "What is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"This gentleman has evidently been held up
by a party of Boers belonging to Christian
Uys's commando," replied Morton.  "The
rascals have looted him of a bag containing
five hundred sovereigns."
</p>

<p>
"Great Scot! that is what I call a haul,"
exclaimed a young trooper.  "I didn't think
there was so much money to be found in this
blessed country.  Give me New Zealand in
preference to this wilderness."
</p>

<p>
"We're Auckland Rangers," explained
Trooper Morton to Mr. Lovat, "and are on
the track of Christian Uys, one of the best
leaders the Boers possess.  He is on the look-out
for horses and stores, I think, and although
we have been dogging his commando for
some days we have not been able to come
up with them.  Ah! here come our other
fellows."
</p>

<p>
A party of horsemen in files of four came
clattering along the stony road, and presently
halted at the entrance to the farmyard.  The
troopers were about thirty in number&mdash;hardy,
stalwart young Maorilanders&mdash;commanded by
Major Salkeld, a Colonial who had done
splendid service during the siege of Wepener.
</p>

<p>
The troop had several spare horses with
them, and after Morton had explained the
situation to his officer, Mr. Lovat was offered a
mount, which he gladly accepted.
</p>

<p>
The horses were given a feed, and the
troopers snatched a hasty meal of bully beef
and biscuit.  During the repast Mr. Lovat
detailed a few facts concerning his farm and
the surrounding country to Major Salkeld, and
it was settled that the party should proceed in
the direction of the Kopje Farm.  Possibly
they might come across the marauders and
be able to restore Mr. Lovat's lost property to
him.
</p>

<p>
The harness belonging to the Cape cart had
been wantonly hacked, so that the idea of the
vehicle's removal had to be abandoned.
</p>

<p>
Kopje Farm lay a good distance up the
valley, and before the little force had proceeded
a mile, Major Salkeld called a halt.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Morton's quick eye had detected
a body of horsemen defiling through a donga
about a mile away on the New Zealander's
left flank.  Morton, who was acting as scout,
at once returned and reported the fact to his
officer, who instantly placed his field glass to
his eyes.  The major looked long and earnestly,
then handing his binocular to Morton, said,
"Just give a glance through these, and tell me
what you make of them."
</p>

<p>
The scout applied the glasses, after which he
handed them back to the major, saying, "They
are Boers, sir, without doubt."
</p>

<p>
"And how many do you make of them?"
inquired the officer.
</p>

<p>
"About forty, I should say, sir," answered
the trooper.  "They have a couple of led
horses with them as well."
</p>

<p>
Major Salkeld turned to Mr. Lovat, who had
been riding by his side, and pointing to the
donga, asked, "Where does the bridle-path
leading to the donga terminate, Mr. Lovat?"
</p>

<p>
"It runs up to a settler's farm, some seven
or eight miles from here," replied Mr. Lovat.
"The settler is a Dutchman named Van
Donnop, and it is said that his three sons are
on commando with the rebels."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" muttered the major, "just so; and
these fellows doubtless are making tracks for
this farm to re-equip and get a fresh supply of
ammunition and stores.  I am sorry that we
cannot see you home, but duty is always duty,
and the exigencies of the service demand that
when we get on the track of the Boers we must
follow them up."
</p>

<p>
"I am going with you, if I may," said
Mr. Lovat.  "Possibly these fellows have my five
hundred pounds, and I can hardly afford to lose
that."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid, my dear sir, that you have
said good-bye to your gold," said the major.
"However, if you care to accompany us, you
can do so.  You are looking better now
than when I saw you first.  I suppose you can
shoot?"
</p>

<p>
"There are not many settlers who can't,"
answered Mr. Lovat, with a touch of dignity in
the tones of his voice.
</p>

<p>
"I mean no offence," said the major.  "Do
you feel strong enough to go with us?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right now," replied the settler.  "My
head is somewhat sore, and the muscles of my
neck a little stiff, but I would rather go on
with you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, you shall," said the officer.
Turning to Morton, he continued, "We have
a spare rifle?"
</p>

<p>
"Half a dozen, sir," answered the trooper.
"I have an extra one with me, which
Mr. Lovat can have, if he understands the
mechanism."
</p>

<p>
"Then kindly hand it over," said the major.
</p>

<p>
Turning again to the settler, the officer
continued, "Luckily you have not been much
troubled in these parts, but I'm afraid you
soon will be.  The Boers are getting short
of ammunition, and these roving bands of
burghers are merely the advanced guard of a
bigger force of Boers.  The supply of
ammunition has been stopped through Lorenzo
Marquess, and the burghers are making their
way to Port Nolloth, and other places on the
west coast, where contraband stuff in the shape
of rifles and cartridges are to be had in plenty.
I suppose the majority of the settlers about
here are loyal?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I can't answer that question
entirely in the affirmative.  I know that I am,
and all living in the Kopje Farm are loyal
subjects of the King.  Many young men have
disappeared from the district, and I saw signs
of the coming storm long before it burst."
</p>

<p>
"What! even in this remote part?" asked
the Colonial officer.
</p>

<p>
"A couple of years before the war broke out,
Boer emissaries went about from place to place,
ostensibly as pedlars, but I am certain they
were secret agents of the Transvaal Republic,"
answered Mr. Lovat.
</p>

<p>
The major addressed a few words to his
men.  They were brief and to the point:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Boys," he began, "I have no doubt that
we are on the track of Christian Uys, and I
sincerely trust we shall be able to lay him
by the heels.  Perhaps this is part of his
commando in front of us.  Be careful with
your ammunition, for we have none to spare.
Don't waste it.  I hope to be in Springbokfontein
to-morrow when the regiment arrives;
but in the evening we must harry the enemy,
who I am pleased to say have on the whole
proved honourable men.  The day after
to-morrow I promise you a couple of days' rest.
Then we move on to Port Nolloth.  Now,
boys, a fairly good pace, but don't blow your
horses."
</p>

<p>
The road, however, was so difficult that
there was no prospect of the latter occurrence
happening.  The troopers could only proceed
in double file, and the men were compelled to
assume an oblong formation, which would have
formed a splendid target for an enemy armed
with Mausers or light field guns.
</p>

<p>
Morton, the most daring man in the
Auckland Rangers, was well in front when a
"Phit!" "Phit!" followed by a fusillade, caused
him to halt.
</p>

<p>
The New Zealanders had been discovered
by the enemy, who by this time had passed out
of view.  The bullets went whistling over the
heads of the Colonials, who, on the order of
Major Salkeld, retired to the shelter of a small
donga, some two hundred yards in their rear.
</p>

<p>
Every fourth man was detailed to lead his
own and three comrades' horses to a
watercourse naturally protected by immense
boulders of quartz.
</p>

<p>
Ten dismounted troopers were next ordered
by the major to creep forward to the position
they had just left, while the rest of the
unencumbered advanced one hundred yards and
flung themselves on the ground.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lovat, savage at the loss of his gold,
begged the officer to allow him to form one
of the advanced party, and the major readily
acceded to his request.
</p>

<p>
The ostrich farmer declared that he was all
right,&mdash;the pain in his head had left him,&mdash;and
Morton having glanced approval, Major Salkeld
consented, and the eleven Imperialists crept
forward on hands and knees towards the spot
they had just vacated.
</p>

<p>
The sun was on the point of dropping below
the western horizon, and in half an hour's time
darkness would cover the veldt, so there was no
time to be lost if the Boers were to be captured.
</p>

<p>
The long, low buildings which constituted
Van Donnop's farmstead could be plainly seen,
but the Boers had disappeared within a donga.
Their approach to the farm, however, would be
covered by the troopers' fire, and Morton and
his fellow-Colonials waited impatiently for the
enemy to emerge from the donga.
</p>

<p>
Presently a couple of Boers dashed across
the space intervening between the donga and
the farm.
</p>

<p>
Two shots rang out, and thin wreaths of
bluish-tinted vapour hung round the muzzles
of the rifles wielded by Mr. Lovat and Trooper
Morton.
</p>

<p>
"Got him!" ejaculated the latter, as one of
the Boers threw up his arms and fell from the
horse.  The animal, relieved of its burden,
galloped wildly towards the farmstead.
</p>

<p>
The second Boer, on seeing his fellow-burgher
fall, wheeled his horse quickly round
and dashed furiously for the shelter of the
donga.
</p>

<p>
A dozen leaden messengers of death whistled
around him, but he and his steed passed
through them unharmed.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of a solitary shot, no fire
came in reply to the troopers' fusillade, and
Morton waved to the remainder of the troop
to come up, which the latter did.
</p>

<p>
A consultation was held between Major
Salkeld and Morton, and it was eventually
decided to await the darkness which would
descend on the veldt.  Under its cover an
advance would be made on the farm.
</p>

<p>
Just as the last streaks of yellow light were
fading into a mass of purplish gray, Morton
begged his major to allow him to creep
forward in the direction of the farm for
the purpose of reconnoitring, and the officer
assented.
</p>

<p>
Slinging his rifle behind his back, the scout
slowly edged his way to where the stricken
Boer lay on the veldt.  The Free Stater was
dead, for a couple of bullets had pierced his
brain.
</p>

<p>
He was a rough-looking man with unkempt
hair and beard, and the daring trooper, still
prostrate, turned him over and coolly began to
search his pockets.
</p>

<p>
Morton abstracted several documents, which
he thrust into an inner pocket of his khaki tunic,
after which he retraced his way to his comrades,
still crawling on his hands and knees.
</p>

<p>
He handed the papers to Major Salkeld,
who determined to advance at once on Van
Donnop's farmstead.  In answer to an
interrogation from his superior, Morton explained
that he had not seen any Boers except the
dead one, and that the Dutch settler's farm
betrayed no sign of life.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later, the New Zealanders were
drawn up in front of the farm buildings, and
Morton, always the first to volunteer for any
hazardous duty, went straight to the front door
of the house and began hammering with the
butt of his rifle upon its stout panels.
</p>

<p>
Footsteps could be heard in the passage, and
a voice called out in Dutch, "Who is there?"
</p>

<p>
"Open the door instantly," commanded
Morton brusquely, "or I'll blow it in."
</p>

<p>
The door was unfastened by a man of
immense girth of chest.  His physiognomy
showed his Dutch extraction.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" demanded the
farmer gruffly.  This time he spoke in
English.
</p>

<p>
Morton in reply gave a shrill whistle, and
the next moment a dozen troopers crowded
into the wide passage, Major Salkeld being
at their head.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, Mynheer&mdash;whatever your name
is, we want to have a look at the stores you
have concealed in this building," began the
major.  "I shall also be glad to learn something
about the whereabouts of Christian Uys and
his commando."
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing about them," answered
Van Donnop, for such he was.
</p>

<p>
"You can tell some other person that tale,"
observed Major Salkeld, with a laugh.  "You
have some food in the house, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
Van Donnop looked at the speaker with a
surly expression on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we shall pay for everything we
consume," continued the officer.  "Look sharp,
my man;" and Van Donnop with bad grace led
the way to a large kitchen, in which half
a dozen Kaffirs, evidently farm hands, were
seated round a log fire.
</p>

<p>
Food was supplied to the troopers, as well
as forage for their horses, after which the
premises were thoroughly searched for
concealed arms; but the hunt proved fruitless.
After paying for the supplies, the major and
his troopers rested for a couple of hours.
</p>

<p>
Sounds of rifle-firing away to the west were
heard, and soon after midnight the New
Zealanders, accompanied by Mr. Lovat, set
out for the Kopje Farm, and all earnestly
hoped they would come across their brave
and stubborn enemy.
</p>

<p>
And so they did; but with the exception of
a few desultory shots fired at an uncertain
range, and without any casualties on their side,
Major Salkeld and his troopers, as related in
the last chapter, arrived on the scene where
Jack Lovat and his handful of Kaffirs had so
bravely defended his father's farmstead.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
DIAMOND VALLEY
</h3>

<p>
Jack Lovat was warmly congratulated by the
New Zealanders on their arrival at the Kopje
Farm, and the ostrich farmer naturally felt
proud of his son.
</p>

<p>
The return of Bessie was described by Jack,
and Trooper Morton said he had no doubt
whatever that the animal which had bolted
when its Boer rider was shot by Trooper
Morton and Mr. Lovat was none other than
the gallant little mare.
</p>

<p>
As soon as daylight broke, the Colonials,
headed by Mr. Lovat, Jack, and Pete, examined
the country in front of the ostrich kraal to a
distance of a thousand paces.
</p>

<p>
Three dead Boers and two horses were
found stretched on the veldt, and Jack Lovat
had no difficulty in identifying the body of Jan
Van Donnop, one of the sons of the Dutch
settler of that name.
</p>

<p>
Jan and his brothers, Piet and Stephanus,
had mysteriously disappeared from the neighbourhood
soon after the outbreak of hostilities,
and their father had given it out that the lads
had gone to reside at East London with a
relative in order to learn the trade of milling.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lovat made a more important discovery.
Attached to the saddle of a dead horse was the
cowhide bag which the previous morning had
contained his five hundred sovereigns, but
which, alas! was now empty.
</p>

<p>
The pockets of the dead Boers revealed no
traces of the lost gold, and Morton remarked,
"I'm afraid, Mr. Lovat, you have said good-bye
to the coin.  None of these men are
leaders."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lovat was examining the features of
one of the dead men, and without heeding
the Colonial's remark, he said, "This fellow is
the man who commandeered Bessie."
</p>

<p>
With the aid of pickaxes and spades, a trench
was made by the New Zealanders, and the
stricken Boers and their horses were decently
interred, Jack Lovat taking charge of several
mementos belonging to Jan Van Donnop.
</p>

<p>
Jack was possessed of a humane nature, and
being far from illiterate and possessing a
cosmopolitan turn of mind, he had not the racial
prejudices so largely predominant during the
awful struggle in South Africa which commenced
at the end of the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p>
Morton had taken intuitively to Jack, and
after the interment he whispered in the lad's
ear, "Why don't you join us?  The war is not
half over yet, and there is sure to be a lot of
fighting.  Ask your father to allow you to
come with us."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid he won't," answered Jack.  "I
wanted to join Driscoll's Scouts, but he
refused, and I believe I have learned the
first duty of a soldier."
</p>

<p>
"And pray, what is that?" queried the
trooper.
</p>

<p>
"Why, obedience," replied Jack.  "I owe
that duty to my father, who is most kind to
me.  Besides, I hardly think it would be right
for me to leave mother and Mary just now.
Mary is my sister.  You saw her when your
fellows came here."
</p>

<p>
"Well, all I can say, youngster, is that you
are a brick and no mistake," said the trooper
enthusiastically.  "What did you feel like
when the Boers came up?  Timid?"
</p>

<p>
"Hardly," remarked Jack laconically.  "I
was only sorry that they didn't try to storm in
broad daylight.  I mean about noon, say."
</p>

<p>
The trooper laughed outright at Jack's bold
statement, and said, "Well, I thought we New
Zealanders were a cool set of fellows, but you
ostrich people take the cake."
</p>

<p>
The pair were approaching the Kopje
Farm, bringing up the rear-guard, when Jack
turned and asked, "You have been a soldier
all your life, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
The trooper laughed as he replied, "Oh
dear no; I'm a working jeweller by trade, and
when at home am engaged by a large firm in
Auckland.  When the mother country called
for men, I volunteered for service in South
Africa.  Why do you ask the question, my lad?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had always been a soldier,
for you look so like one," answered Jack; and
Morton felt a trifle elated, for what man or
boy exists who does not inwardly relish a small
modicum of flattery?
</p>

<p>
"You have nothing in the shape of diamonds,
I suppose, in this part of the country?" queried
the trooper.  "I have examined the clay in
several dongas as we came along, and from
what I know of mineralogy, I should say that
diamonds are to be found in this district."
</p>

<p>
"Crystals are common enough about here,"
answered Jack.  "I have a collection which
I will show you when we reach the farm.
Among the pebbles are several fine garnets
and amethysts.  One of our 'boys,' Pete by
name, picked up a stone, which he found
embedded in a sort of bluish clay only a
fortnight ago.  It is too dull, however, for a
diamond."
</p>

<p>
During the few minutes occupied in the
return to the farm, Morton thought deeply
about what Jack had told him.  He was a
thorough patriot, but since he had been in
South Africa his mind had dwelt largely on
diamonds, for exaggerated accounts of the
mineral resources of the veldt had reached
New Zealand.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lovat was a thoughtful man, and since
the beginning of the war had laid up big
supplies of eatables in the shape of hams,
bacon, preserved meats, and tins of jam and
marmalade.
</p>

<p>
It seemed as though the Kopje Farm had
been designedly prepared for a siege, for in
the big storeroom at the back of the house
were provisions calculated by Mr. Lovat to
last at least twelve months, and these were
being added to.
</p>

<p>
The major determined to allow his men a
few hours' rest, and the horses were off-saddled
and given a good feed of corn, Jack Lovat
paying particular attention to Morton's mare,
which was a magnificent creature nearly
seventeen hands high, and noted for its swiftness
and sureness of foot.
</p>

<p>
Jack conducted his newly-made friend round
the ostrich kraal, and explained the various
operations connected with the hatching of eggs
and the plucking of the birds' plumage, and the
trooper evinced great interest in the young
settler's narration.
</p>

<p>
The remains of poor Zacchary, the "boy"
who was shot at the loophole, had been
reverently interred, and Jack and his friend
were standing alone beside the mound of
freshly turned earth, when the latter observed,
"Oh, by the way, Jack, I would very much
like to have a look at that stone you spoke to
me about."
</p>

<p>
"You mean the pebble Pete gave to me?"
asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think that is the nigger's name,"
replied Morton.
</p>

<p>
To the trooper's great surprise, Jack instantly
fired up.  "No, that won't do; we don't call
our 'boys' niggers.  They are our 'boys,' and
faithful ones they are, too."
</p>

<p>
The New Zealander smiled at Jack's
impetuosity, and remarked, "A very good trait in
your character.  Only we have seen so many
Kaffirs since we have been in the country that
all nice distinctions are washed out, and we call
the blacks generally 'niggers,'&mdash;not a very
gentlemanly expression, I admit."
</p>

<p>
"Our 'boys' maybe are above the general
run," said Jack, "but they are tried and trusty
ones.  I shall never forget how they
volunteered to a man to defend this place, when
they might have slunk away.  Their fate, too,
if captured, they well knew, for they would
have been brutally sjambokked and then shot.
The boys stood up as good as the best of
white men, and I admire them.  Poor old
Zacchary!  Oh, you spoke about the stone
my father's native foreman gave me; I will
bring it;" and Jack walked across to the house,
the New Zealander all the while admiring the
stalwart figure of the ostrich farmer's son.
</p>

<p>
Jack presently returned, and handed the
stone to Morton, who carefully examined it
with the eye of an expert.
</p>

<p>
The pebble was about the size of a large
hazel nut, with a straw-coloured tint, and
Morton twirled it between his finger and thumb
for quite a minute before speaking.
</p>

<br />
&quot;The Colonial cut the cords.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what this pebble really is?"
he asked.  An unusual brightness shone in his
eyes as he spoke, and he glanced keenly at
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"A pebble, of course," answered our hero.
"Pete said he saw several others of the same
kind where he found this one."
</p>

<p>
"And where did Pete find the stone?"
queried the trooper.
</p>

<p>
"In a donga about a couple of miles from
here, just over the kopje," answered Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you something later on," said
Morton,&mdash;"a thing that will probably astonish
you."
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat's eyes opened rather wider than
usual as he asked, "Is the pebble a diamond?"
</p>

<p>
"A genuine stone, my lad, and just as good
in quality as the Kohinoor.  If you can lay
your fingers on a dozen more such stones, you
can give up ostrich farming and go back to
the old country."
</p>

<p>
"If you are staying here any length of
time, perhaps you will go with me to the
donga.  Pete knows the spot to a nicety," said
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"We'll see," remarked the trooper.  "I must
look up the major and learn his plans.  I
should like nothing better than to pay a visit
to this wonderful donga.  You will excuse me
now;" and he strode off towards his
troopers, who were engaged in rubbing down
their horses.
</p>

<p>
A hardier lot of warriors than the men of
C Troop Auckland Rangers, it would be difficult
to find or even imagine.  Their ages ranged
from twenty to forty, every man of them
standing six feet and over.  Maoriland indeed had
sent its best sons to do battle for the empire,
the centre of which is the little sea-girt isle
whose ensign is the Union Jack.
</p>

<p>
The New Zealanders were right royally
treated by the owner of the Kopje Farm, and
Major Salkeld determined to remain until
evening, when the horses would be up-saddled
and preparations made for the march to
Springbokfontein.
</p>

<p>
This was just what Morton desired, and at
noon, guided by Jack Lovat and Pete, the
New Zealander set out for the donga where
the Kaffir had found the crystal.
</p>

<p>
Each of the trio carried a rifle, with a supply
of ammunition.  The ascent of the kopje
was made with considerable difficulty; for path
there was none, and treacherous holes were
abundant.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful," said Jack, turning round to the
Colonial.  "A broken leg, or maybe two, won't
be very nice."
</p>

<p>
"All right, my lad; I'm on the look-out for
possible squalls," answered the trooper.  "I
wonder if we shall come across any Boers."
</p>

<p>
"That is hardly likely," observed Jack.
"There are no roads beyond the top of the
kopje, and no farms for a dozen miles."
</p>

<p>
The summit of the kopje was reached, when
a grand panorama spread out in front of Jack
Lovat and his two companions.  Rheni Kop,
a rugged kopje with a part of its summit
shaped like the tower of a castle, loomed some
half-dozen miles away.  Leading to the kopje
were two deep dongas, and it was to the one
on the right that the trio were bound.  For
many years the donga had been known as
Diamond Valley.
</p>

<p>
"Tell the 'boy' to lie down," said Morton,
as soon as they arrived at the top of the kopje;
"and you as well, Jack," he went on.  "I want
to have a peep round the country with my
glasses.  People don't look well sometimes on
the skyline."
</p>

<p>
Jack and Pete at once obeyed instructions;
and Morton, taking out his glasses, for a few
moments peered through them.
</p>

<p>
"All's correct," he said, after replacing the
glasses in their leather case.  "I don't think
any doppers are about here.  And now, Jack,
kindly instruct your 'boy' to show us the place
where he found the pebble."
</p>

<p>
Jack said something to Pete in a low tone
of voice, to which the Kaffir replied, "All
right, Baas Jack.  Come along;" and leading
the way, Pete with careful steps made tracks
towards the donga on the right.
</p>

<p>
Progress was necessarily slow, for boulders
of rock, and little gullies are not conducive to
rapid locomotion.
</p>

<p>
Onward the three tramped for a distance of
half a mile, when Pete halted at a part of the
donga where its side rose almost perpendicularly
to a height of ten or twelve feet.
</p>

<p>
The rock was composed of gneiss, along
which bands of bluish-coloured clay ran in
horizontal layers.
</p>

<p>
"Dis was de place where I found de glass
pebble, Baas Jack," said the Kaffir, pointing
to a ledge of rock through which a small
stream of water trickled.
</p>

<p>
Morton by this time had pulled out a large
clasp knife and was engaged in chipping off
portions of the blue clay, which yielded readily
to the impact of the knife.
</p>

<p>
The weapon struck something hard, and
withdrawing the knife, Morton cut away the
clay surrounding it.  After all, the object
might only be a fragment of rock, but the New
Zealander's heart began to beat faster than was
its wont.
</p>

<p>
"By heavens," he muttered, "if this turns
out to be a klip (diamond)!"
</p>

<p>
Presently the stone was in his hand, and he
anxiously pared off the fragments of blue clay
adhering to it.
</p>

<p>
"A crystallised stone, at any rate," he ejaculated,
placing the find in the breast pocket of
his tunic.  He again proceeded to excavate
more clay, when he was arrested by a cry from
the Kaffir.  "Look, Baas Jack," exclaimed Pete.
"De Boers! de Boers!"
</p>

<p>
Morton's knife dropped out of his hand, and
hastily picking up his rifle, he queried, "Where
are they, Pete?"
</p>

<p>
"Down dere, baas," answered the Kaffir.
"I saw de heads ob two Boers peep ober,
about five hundred yards away.  I am sure
dey must&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Pete's answer was prematurely finished, for
the "pip-pop" of half a dozen Mausers rang
out, and the next moment Jack Lovat, with
blanched face, was lying on the ground, and a
stream of blood trickled down the left sleeve
of his jacket.  Jack's rifle slipped from his
grasp, and but for the safety catch, a bullet
would probably have whizzed near Morton;
for the barrel rested on a fragment of rock,
and the New Zealander was directly in the
line of fire.
</p>

<p>
The latter bent over Jack, who was writhing
with pain.  It was only the work of a moment
for Morton to pick up his clasp knife and rip
open a seam of the garment.
</p>

<p>
Jack, although a brave lad, winced, while
the trooper examined the wound.
</p>

<p>
"Only a flesh hurt," said Morton; "lucky,
though!" and swiftly applying the field
dressing, he bound up the injured limb.
</p>

<p>
Another peculiar whistle heralded the
approach of a shower of bullets fired by unseen
marksmen.
</p>

<p>
"I guess we are in a tight hole now,"
soliloquised Morton.  "We'll have to get a
place of shelter somehow.  Can you manage
to walk, my lad?" addressing Jack.  But our
hero was already on his feet.
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right now," answered Jack, although
he looked far from being in that desirable
state.
</p>

<p>
"We must get down to the donga as quickly
as possible; there will be more shelter.  I'll
carry you, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" said Jack.  "I can manage to
walk.  You might take my rifle, please, for my
arm seems paralysed."
</p>

<p>
With some difficulty, Jack Lovat and his two
companions made tracks for the kopje overlooking
his father's farm, but long before the
summit over which they meant to pass on their
hands and knees was reached, Morton was
bowled over by a bullet, and but for the
friendly protection of a shoulder-strap buckle,
would undoubtedly have been killed.  As it
was, the missile, after being deflected by the
buckle, lodged in the muscles of his upper right
arm, and rendered that member useless.
</p>

<p>
Although in great pain, with blood trickling
from the unstanched wound, the New
Zealander, forming the rear-guard, turned his
face in the direction of the Kopje Farm, and
with tightened lips moved forward towards
the summit.
</p>

<p>
They had not proceeded more than a hundred
paces when the scout stumbled and fell.
</p>

<p>
The hardy frame of the New Zealander,
stricken as he was, could not stand the strain,
and he tumbled over in a dead faint.
</p>

<p>
"This is a predicament, Pete," said Jack, as
he bent over the prostrate figure.  "We must,
however, get to some place of shelter;" and
the brave lad looked around him.
</p>

<p>
A natural cave opened its yawning mouth
about fifty yards away, and towards its friendly
shelter Pete and Jack managed to drag their
still unconscious ally.
</p>

<p>
The firing had ceased, but Jack had the
conviction they were still being watched by the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
The cave was the mouth of a depression
such as is commonly seen among the kopjes
of South Africa, and with some difficulty, for
Jack's arm was powerless, the wounded trooper
was carried inside.  Morton soon regained
consciousness, but his mind was clouded, and
he talked somewhat incoherently.
</p>

<p>
"Keep the beggars off, my lad," he said to
Jack.  "This confounded wound has disabled me."
</p>

<p>
Our hero asked for the loan of Morton's
glasses, and creeping to the mouth of the cave,
glanced along the donga.
</p>

<p>
He thought he saw objects above the rocks
at a distance of some five hundred paces, and
came to the conclusion that what he saw were
slouch-hats worn by invading Boers.
</p>

<p>
The slouch-hats seemed to advance.  He
glanced again, but boulders of rock only met
his gaze.  Soon the hats grew larger in size
and number, and a mist spread before Jack's
vision.  Rheni Kop with its castellated tower
became a blurred image, even through the
clear atmosphere of the veldt.
</p>

<p>
"Pete!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Baas Jack," answered the Kaffir.
</p>

<p>
"Come here, and tell me what you make of
these things."
</p>

<p>
The Kaffir crept to Jack's side, but refused
the glasses which Jack had handed to him.
</p>

<p>
"My eyes are good, baas.  I can see well
widout dese," said Pete.  "We are done for,
Baas Jack.  More dan fifty ob de rascals are
coming.  Shall I fire, baas?"
</p>

<p>
"No, certainly not, Pete," replied Jack,
whose wound had infused in the lad's mind a
certain amount of wholesome discretion.
</p>

<p>
"Dey have de white flag up, baas," said
Pete.  "Dere be five comin' dis way.  Shall
I fire?" and the eyes of the Kaffir sparkled.
Pete went on: "De foremost one is Piet
Van Donnop, de brute who once sjambokked
me for nuthing.  May I fire, baas?
I can bring him down like an aasvogel
(vulture)."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing of the sort, Pete," replied Jack.
"We are powerless.  Let them come on."
</p>

<p>
"All right, baas," said Pete.  "If you say
dat, they might as well see me;" and the Kaffir
slipped outside the cave, carrying his rifle with
him.
</p>

<p>
"Come back, you fool!" cried Jack; but he
was powerless to prevent his father's native
foreman from disobeying his command.
</p>

<p>
Pete gazed with an air of nonchalance at the
approaching figures, who were now only three
hundred yards away.  The Kaffir stood leaning
on his rifle.  His brows were knitted, and
all the wild savagery of his nature was
aroused.
</p>

<p>
The Boers halted, and presently two of their
number, one of them carrying a white handkerchief
affixed to the barrel of his rifle, advanced
towards Pete.
</p>

<p>
The latter glanced at the breech of his rifle,
opened it, after which his eyes enlarged in
wonderment.  The breech and magazine were
empty.  Jack Lovat, who was peering over the
edge of the cave, cried, "Drop your rifle, Pete!"
but the command was not obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"Dey shall see no hands ob mine go up,"
muttered the Kaffir; "an' if de Boer is Piet
Van Donnop, he can look out."
</p>

<p>
The strangers advanced, and the next
moment Jack Lovat heard the cry, "Hands
up, 'boy,' or we'll fire!"
</p>

<p>
Pete clutched his rifle, and advancing a few
paces, delivered a stroke with the butt of his
weapon on the head of the foremost Boer, and
the latter tumbled over.
</p>

<p>
A moment later, brave Pete, the Kaffir
"boy," fell, pierced through the brain by a bullet.
He expired almost instantly, leaving his young
master and the wounded New Zealander helpless
in the hands of the Boers.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
A CAPE REBEL
</h3>

<p>
The Dutchman whom the unfortunate Pete
had floored was Piet Van Donnop, a son of
the farmer of that name.  Although stunned
by the blow administered by the Kaffir, he
soon regained consciousness.
</p>

<p>
A number of infuriated Boers stood around
the mouth of the cave, gesticulating wildly in
the guttural Taal tongue.
</p>

<p>
Jack and Morton could both be plainly seen.
The ostrich farmer's son had risen to his feet,
and gazing steadily at a Boer who had covered
him with his rifle, cried, "Shoot, you coward!"
</p>

<p>
The next moment would have been Jack's
last, had not a powerful arm struck up the rifle
barrel.  Piet Van Donnop saved our hero's
life.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is you, Lovat," said Piet, whose
head was covered with a bloodstained bandage.
"What are you doing here, and who is your
companion?  Ah! one of the rooibaatjes, I
see."
</p>

<p>
Morton struggled to his feet and faced the
Boers.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a rooibaatje," said Morton, "but I
am fighting in their cause.  You can do your
worst.  I'm not a hands-upper, or a white-flagger
either," he continued scornfully.
</p>

<p>
The Boers withdrew a few paces, but not
before securing the two rifles and the
bandoliers worn by Jack and Morton.
</p>

<p>
A consultation took place among the
burghers, and Jack's quick ears detected
among other sentences the words, "Shoot the
dogs."  Their fate was evidently trembling in
the balance, and Jack's thoughts wandered to
the Kopje Farm, his father, mother, and Mary.
</p>

<p>
Then a bearded man of immense stature
stepped into the cave and approached Morton,
who with a pallid face was leaning against a
boulder of rock.
</p>

<p>
The Boer addressed Morton in good
English.  "To what regiment do you belong,
rooinek?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"That is my business," answered the scout
haughtily.  "I decline to answer."
</p>

<p>
"Where are your fellows?" asked the Boer,
without displaying any sign of temper.
</p>

<p>
"I decline to give you any information
whatever," replied Morton.
</p>

<p>
"A sjambok may elicit what I desire to
know," said the Boer grimly.  "You are
speaking now to Christian Uys.  You have heard
of me, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I have," answered the scout.
"We have been trying for some time to
locate you."
</p>

<p>
"Pray be careful in what you say," said Uys.
"You are not an Englishman?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not," said Morton, "but I fight under
the British flag."
</p>

<p>
"You belong to the New Zealand corps
called Rangers," said Uys in a peculiar tone
of voice.  "You see we burghers can beat
your boasted Intelligence Department.  Bah! the
British Government with their hundreds of
thousands of rooibaatjes cannot beat a few simple
farmers;" and Uys gave vent to a loud laugh.
</p>

<p>
The Boer went on: "We want to catch a
man of your regiment.  Morton is his name.
You know him, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"I decline to answer any of your questions,"
replied the trooper firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, when you reach your corps, you
might tell this Morton, that if we catch him,
a sjambokking awaits him, followed by a dose
of lead.  He has already killed five of my best
men."
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat was listening with bated breath
to the conversation, and he wondered at the
cool courage displayed by the New Zealander.
</p>

<p>
Piet Van Donnop came forward in answer
to something put to him by the Boer leader.
</p>

<p>
"How is your father, Jack?" asked Piet;
"and I must not forget your mother and
little Mary.  I suppose she is quite a woman
by now."
</p>

<p>
"They are all right," replied Jack.  "I
never thought you would have joined the
rebels, Piet."
</p>

<p>
"And why not, Jack?" asked Piet.  "They
are my own flesh and blood, and I am only
fighting for my own.  The commandant wishes
me to ask you how many troopers are quartered
at the Kopje Farm?  I ought to have been
there now, but I am acting as despatch rider
for the commando."
</p>

<p>
The question was put in Dutch, a language
Morton was not conversant with.
</p>

<p>
"The commandant had better find out
for himself.  You will get a warm reception
if you go to the Kopje Farm," replied Jack
testily.
</p>

<p>
"That is just what we are going to do," said
Van Donnop.  "I have my brother Jan's
death to avenge.  I have heard he is dead."
</p>

<p>
"But not on my father, Piet?" queried Jack.
"His only fault is that of being a loyalist.  You
had better tell the commandant to leave the
Kopje Farm severely alone, if his men don't
want to receive a shock from which they will
not soon recover."
</p>

<p>
Piet laughed at this, after which he said,
"All right, Jack, you have to come with us.
Your friend will remain where he is until we
come back for him."
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't leave him," cried Jack.
Turning to Morton, he went on: "They
want me to go along with them and leave
you here, but Jack Lovat is hardly built that
way."
</p>

<p>
The trooper stared, and there was a world of
meaning in the glance he bestowed on Jack.
The glance said quite plainly, "Go," and the
look was accentuated by a slight nod.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-100"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-100.jpg" alt="&quot;Pete delivered a stroke with his weapon.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;Pete delivered a stroke with his weapon.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"We must trouble you for those boots," said
the commandant.  "No, we want nothing else.
I see the spurs are pretty well worn.  It won't
be policy on your part to offer any resistance.
Hans Erasmus," calling to one of his men,
"you are badly in need of a pair of boots.
Take these," and he pointed to Morton's boots.
The Boer, an unkempt fellow, whose clothes
were almost in rags, certainly was in need of
foot-gear, for the soles had left the uppers, and
his toes protruded from beneath the untanned
leather.  To Jack's surprise, Morton made no
resistance, but allowed the Boer to annex the
boots.
</p>

<p>
The latter soon transferred them to his own
feet, and expressed his satisfaction at the
exchange by uttering a guttural "Ach!"
</p>

<p>
"You are wounded?" said Uys, addressing
Morton.
</p>

<p>
"I would not be here talking to you if I had
not been," replied the trooper.  "It is a mere
scratch, though.  You don't use expanding
bullets, or explosive ones, for that matter.  It
is very good of you, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be sarcastic, my good man.  You
are quite sure you can make yourself
comfortable till we come back?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall be all right," replied Morton.
"The sooner you leave me the better I shall
like it."
</p>

<p>
Commandant Uys smiled.  "You are rather
a humorous sort of fellow.  May I ask you one
question?"
</p>

<p>
"As you please," answered Morton gruffly.
</p>

<p>
"How long will it take for you to reach the
Kopje Farm?  Don't stare, my man.  We
are pretty well informed as to all movements
made by the rooibaatjes.  I should ask you to
unstrip your tunic, but that would be a waste
of energy, because you Colonials who act as
scouts carry no identity cards.  I am afraid we
must inconvenience you for a little time.  You
shall not, however, go hungry.  Stephanus, a
piece of biltong for the rooinek.  You will
like it, for it is good fare while serving on
the veldt."
</p>

<p>
Saying this, Commandant Uys strode out of
the cave to where his burghers were standing
near their horses.
</p>

<p>
A minute later, Morton, whether against his
wish or not, found his ankles firmly secured by
a piece of hide rope.  His hands had been
left unbound, but without a knife it was an
impossibility to set himself free, and that
instrument had been taken from him.
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat was compelled to mount one of
the spare horses belonging to the sections of
the commando, and to his infinite satisfaction
found that the horses' heads were turned in the
direction of Rheni Kop, instead of the Kopje
Farm.  A bullet between his ribs from the rifle
of a Britisher was too unpleasant a possibility
to contemplate, so he felt devoutly thankful
when he found himself proceeding in an
opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
Glances full of meaning had passed between
Jack and Morton, and the latter knew that his
boy-friend would leave no stone unturned to
assist him from his unenviable position.
</p>

<p>
After leaving the cave, the Boers rode
straight on Rheni Kop, Piet Donnop being
alongside our friend Jack.
</p>

<p>
"What brings you here, Lovat?" asked
Piet in English, and speaking in a whisper.
"Diamond Valley seems to have an
attraction for you."
</p>

<p>
"And for you as well, I should say," retorted
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Looking after gold, or what?" queried Piet.
</p>

<p>
"I was not aware that gold is to be found in
these parts," answered Jack.  "What do you
mean by roaming about the country, robbing
and molesting peaceable inhabitants?  Do
you know anything about the five hundred
sovereigns my father lost only yesterday?"
</p>

<p>
A flush spread over the Dutchman's swarthy
face as he answered, "I have had none of
Mr. Lovat's sovereigns."
</p>

<p>
"Then you know about the way my father
has been treated?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
Piet evaded the question, and merely said,
"I am sorry we came up with you to-day,
Lovat.  I, at least, bear you no ill-will; but I
would strongly advise you to keep your tongue
still and ask no ugly questions.  It is
unfortunate that we met you.  Does your wound
pain you?"
</p>

<p>
"Only a slight stiffness and soreness
inconveniences me&mdash;that is all," answered Jack.
"By the way, where are we bound for?"
</p>

<p>
"Number one, ugly question," replied Piet.
"I may as well tell you that you won't see
Kopje Farm to-night, and most probably not
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"And what about my friend whom you have
tied up in the cave?  You will surely never
leave him to starve?" queried Jack.
</p>

<p>
"By no means," answered Piet, with a laugh.
"He will be released in good time&mdash;that is,
when the commandant thinks fit.  Christian
Uys has something up his sleeve."  The last
sentence was uttered in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"And what is that, Van Donnop?"
</p>

<p>
"Ugly question, number two," was the
Dutchman's response.  "You know what you
Britishers say, 'The third time is
catching-time.'  I am right, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
After that, Jack Lovat held his peace, but
did not forget to use his eyes.  Life on the
veldt had taught him many lessons.  Like the
Red Indians of the western prairies, Jack had
studied rocks, flowers, the sun, moon, and stars
in their various phases, and in veldt-craft was
becoming a past-master.
</p>

<p>
For an hour the commando rode ahead, and
when halted by order of Christian Uys, had
passed round Rheni Kop, which now stood
four or five miles on their left flank.
</p>

<p>
The Boers debouched on a grassy plain,
very limited in extent, and surrounded by little
flat-topped kopjes.
</p>

<p>
To Jack's immense surprise, he saw forty or
fifty waggons and Cape carts on the plain.
Several hundred horses and many head of oxen
were grazing on the veldt, and at least two
hundred additional burghers were in the laager.
</p>

<p>
These formed the major portion of the
formidable Christian Uys's commando, and
Jack Lovat as he passed into the laager
thought he had never seen such a motley
crew.
</p>

<p>
Many of the burghers glanced at Jack
from beneath their bushy eyebrows, bestowing
ominous scowls on the young Britisher, which
he answered with a haughty stare.
</p>

<p>
The burghers off-saddled, and after giving
their horses a feed of mealies, began to refresh
themselves with a repast of biltong, biscuits,
and jam.
</p>

<p>
Jack was placed under a guard, one of whom
he was glad to find was Piet Van Donnop.
Under his protection our hero knew that he
would receive no ill-treatment.
</p>

<p>
Van Donnop insisted upon Jack receiving
medical treatment from a burgher who had
walked a Berlin hospital, but whose indiscretions
had caused him to be expelled before he took
his degree.
</p>

<p>
Dirck Hartmann, for such was the medico's
name, proved a very agreeable sort of young
fellow, and showed great kindness to Jack.  He
examined the boy's wound, and found that a
bullet had passed through the fleshy inner
portion of the arm, luckily without touching an
artery.  As Jack said, it was a scratch&mdash;an
ugly one it must be said; but the prompt
application of the field dressing by Morton had
minimised the loss of blood.  The limb felt
stiff and sore&mdash;that was all.
</p>

<p>
"You will see that this young fellow has
good treatment," said Hartmann to Piet Van
Donnop, as he left Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, doctor," was Piet's reply.  "He
is in safe hands with me;" for which Jack
thanked him.
</p>

<p>
As the sun was on the point of dropping
below the horizon, the Boer sentries were
planted on the kopjes surrounding the plateau,
and Jack was ordered to crawl into a waggon,
on the floor of which were spread several layers
of empty mealie bags.
</p>

<p>
Before he went to roost, Jack's observant
eyes had been busy.  He noticed with keen
interest the picketing of the horses in the
immediate vicinity, and deep satisfaction sprang
up in his breast as he thought of a sharp bowie
knife which he carried in the leg of one of his
high boots.
</p>

<p>
He had made a strong resolve to get away
from the laager before morning broke, and he
determined that nothing short of utter
disablement would prevent him from accomplishing
his purpose.
</p>

<p>
The resolve was strengthened by a conversation
he overheard between two burghers, soon
after darkness fell.  Jack's thoughts were
passing between the bowie knife, secreted in his
boot, and the picketed horses.  Among the
latter was a beautiful roan, evidently the
property of a field-cornet or other officer.
</p>

<p>
His mind also wandered to the Kopje Farm.
He wondered what they were doing, and if
Major Salkeld and his men had departed for
Springbokfontein.  Then he thought of Morton
lying bound in the cave in Diamond Valley.
</p>

<p>
Jack had stretched himself on the mealie
sacks when he heard his family name mentioned,
and his ears were all attention in a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Hans," said a voice in a low whisper, "the
rooineks will have no chance at all.  Johann
Klaasen has just come in, and reports that
thirty of them are leaving the Kopje Farm for
Springbokfontein in the early dawn to-morrow.
That is good news, for every man of them will
be shot down before they have proceeded two
miles on their journey.  Half of the commando&mdash;one
hundred and fifty strong&mdash;have left for
Langeman's Nek, where there is abundant
shelter for our men.  These New Zealanders
boast about never requiring quarter.  They
will get none;" and a low chuckle followed.
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat's breath came thick and fast.
He knew Langeman's Nek very well, and as
the speaker hinted, he knew it formed an
admirable place of ambush.
</p>

<p>
The minutes seemed to pass on leaden wings
to the British youth so strangely confined in
the camp of a savage enemy.  Jack's mind
was made up.  He would use his utmost
endeavour to escape from the laager, and if he
could not secure the roan mare, make his way
on foot to the Kopje Farm, provided no other
mount came in his way.
</p>

<p>
At last complete silence reigned in the laager,
and Jack cautiously raised himself on his elbow
and peered over the side of the waggon.  His
sense of hearing was overstrained by his
peculiar and dangerous position.  He thought
he heard the flap of a rifle-strap as if it struck
the barrel of a Mauser rifle, and lay quietly
down again.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, he again pulled himself
up, and without noise clambered over the side
of the waggon, then dropped on the ground.
His wounded arm caused him much pain, but
he set his teeth and bore it bravely.  The night
was a black one, but his keen eyesight informed
him that the picketed horses had been removed
from the vicinity of the waggon.
</p>

<p>
Jack fell on his hands and knees, and crawled
forward, cautiously winding his way between
the wheels of several waggons.
</p>

<p>
At last he was clear of the laager, and the
ring of pickets only had to be passed.  Still on
his hands and knees he crept, his heart beating
violently, and sharp pains darting through his
temples.  If only he could get safely through, he
would trust to Providence to guide him safely
to the Kopje Farm.
</p>

<p>
A gaunt figure, standing by a horse, attracted
his attention, and a voice called out in Dutch,
"Who goes there?"  The question was followed
by an ominous clicking sound.  Jack still
crawled forward, his right hand now gripping
the bowie knife.  His strength was almost
exhausted, and the pain in his arm increased in
severity.
</p>

<p>
With rare courage and determination, Jack
sprang to his feet, plunged the bowie knife into
the chest of the bewildered sentry, who
immediately fell, at the same time relaxing his
grasp of the horse's reins.  It took but a
moment for Jack to mount, and digging his
spurless boots into the sides of the
commandeered property, he darted across the veldt.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
A WEIRD ADVENTURE
</h3>

<p>
For a couple of miles Jack rode hard across
the veldt&mdash;not without risk, for several rifle
shots rang out, and bullets whizzed perilously
near his ears.  His escape had evidently been
discovered.
</p>

<p>
When he pulled up his panting steed, he
had completely lost his bearings.  All that he
could do was to wait for the rising of the moon,
when he trusted to his knowledge of veldtcraft
to guide him to the Kopje Farm.
</p>

<p>
The horse which he rode was flecked with
foam, and the poor brute trembled in every limb.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I reckon I'm in a fine pickle now,"
muttered Jack, as he dismounted.  Slipping his
arm into the horse's bridle, he led the animal
towards a small kopje, whose summit was
indistinctly lined against the dark sky.
</p>

<p>
He had an idea that he had seen the kopje
before, but was not sure.  He would wait a
little longer.
</p>

<p>
The base of the kopje was fringed with a
growth of various kinds of bushes, and the
fear of tumbling into unseen depressions on
the veldt, and prospective chances of broken
limbs, made him very cautious.
</p>

<p>
The welcome light of the moon soon spread
over the veldt, and Jack examined the saddlery
on the back of his newly acquired steed.
</p>

<p>
To his great joy, he found a holster-case
attached to the saddle, and inside the case was
a revolver loaded in every chamber.  He was
now provided with a means of defence, if
attacked by man or beast.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice, he had heard what seemed to
be low rumblings of thunder; but the sky was
clear, and the wonderful stars glittered with a
brightness only seen in Southern latitudes.
</p>

<p>
He tried to locate his position, but had to
dolefully confess to himself that he was lost,
and that he could not recognise any spot on
the landscape.
</p>

<p>
The horse was still trembling in every limb,
as though some unknown terror were creeping
over it.  He tried to drag the beast forward,
but it refused to budge, and a strange fear
crept through Jack's mind.
</p>

<p>
He had had a little experience of the king
of beasts, and he came to the conclusion that
the horse had scented danger in the shape of
lions.
</p>

<p>
His fears were soon realised, for a loud roar
burst upon his ears, and two pairs of shining
yellow eyes peered at him from beneath a big
mimosa bush.
</p>

<p>
His heart sank as it were into his boots, and
he dragged his horse's head round.  His first
thought was to mount and make all haste from
the spot, but his limbs seemed temporarily
paralysed.
</p>

<p>
The growling increased, beginning with a
blood-curdling wail that ended in a terrific roar.
</p>

<p>
The ground seemed to tremble beneath
Jack's feet, and he gave himself up for lost.
The opposition of armed men had no terrors
for Jack Lovat, but he could not contemplate
with equanimity the probability of being
devoured piecemeal by infuriated lions.
</p>

<p>
He retreated slowly, still leading the horse,
but keeping his eyes fixed on the globes of fire
which seemed to advance.
</p>

<p>
Two long tawny forms began a crouching
march towards the ostrich farmer's son, and
Jack clutched the revolver with a nervous grip,
his forefinger pressing lightly on the trigger.
If the horse should happen to break away, all
would be up.
</p>

<p>
The tawny forms were but a few paces away,
crouching low down, as though about to make
a spring, so grasping the pommel of the saddle,
with an energy born of despair, Jack vaulted
into the seat, and set forth at a rapid gallop.
</p>

<p>
His spirits rose as he sped onwards, and
he was congratulating himself upon his very
narrow escape, when his horse stumbled and
fell on the veldt, with a terrible crash, throwing
Jack over its head.
</p>

<p>
Our hero thought that every bone in his
body had been broken, but he managed to
stumble to his feet.
</p>

<p>
To his horror, he found that his horse's right
fore-leg was broken, and the poor beast unable
to stand.
</p>

<p>
The two hideous forms were following, and
even now were only a few yards distant.
</p>

<p>
Jack prayed fervently for deliverance, and
before he could realise what was happening, the
fierce brutes had sprung upon the horse, which
was screaming in agony.
</p>

<p>
He could hear a terrible crunching sound as
the lions began munching their yet alive prey.
</p>

<p>
He dared not expend a shot, and deeming
prudence to be the better part of valour, he left
the unfortunate horse to the cruel mercies of
the lions, and ran as fast as he could across the
veldt, trusting that the savage beasts would
satiate their hunger upon the horse's carcass,
and refrain from pursuing him.
</p>

<p>
He felt sick and weary.  His wound had
induced a fever, which made him somewhat
light-headed.  He stopped running, and trudged
doggedly along, in what direction he knew not.
</p>

<p>
How long he wandered he never knew, but
he halted when he came to a donga; for a fire,
burning brightly, pulled him up.
</p>

<p>
He saw the glare of the fire when some
distance from it, and conjectured that a party
of Boers or British Irregulars on trek had
encamped for the night in the donga.
</p>

<p>
The figures of several men, evidently asleep,
were seated round the fire, while some distance
away from the latter, a number of horses were
picketed, and grazing upon the sparse grass.
</p>

<p>
Jack's eyesight was good, despite the rough
experience he had recently gone through, and
lying flat on his stomach, he watched the
strange spectacle.
</p>

<p>
An uncouth-looking figure emerged from
the gloom, and going towards the sleepers,
awakened two of them.
</p>

<p>
"Changing sentries," soliloquised Jack.
"They are not our fellows&mdash;Boers, without a
doubt."
</p>

<p>
And Boers they were.  Jack had stumbled
across a patrol of the enemy, and a fear of
again falling into their hands crept across his
mind.
</p>

<p>
Fear soon gave way to certainty, for one of
the lately aroused Boers&mdash;a thick-set, unwieldy
man&mdash;came stalking towards the place where
Jack was lying.
</p>

<p>
A Mauser rifle reposed in the hollow of the
Boer's left arm, and gleams of light played on
the barrel.
</p>

<p>
The Dutchman nearly stepped upon Jack,
before he saw our hero; then bringing his rifle
to the present, the Boer cried, "Who goes
there?  Speak, or I'll fire!"  This was said
in deep guttural Dutch, and the next moment
Jack found himself again a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
Our hero felt thankful that he had not fallen
into the hands of Transvaalers, who, justly or
unjustly, bore a shady reputation for cruelty.
</p>

<p>
"Who and what are you?" demanded the
Boer.  "A rooinek?"  The tones of the Free
Stater were not unkind.
</p>

<p>
"Are there any more of you?" the sentry
continued, glancing warily around.
</p>

<p>
"I am alone," replied Jack, who when he
saw the Boer advancing towards him, threw
his revolver away.
</p>

<p>
"Alone?" said the Boer.  "And why are
you prowling about here at this time of the
night?  You speak our language well.  Are
you one of us, or what?"
</p>

<p>
Jack made no reply, and the Boer commanded
him to move towards the camp-fire,
bringing up the rear.
</p>

<p>
Here the Boer roused up a man, dressed
in somewhat superior clothing to his fellows,
and whom he addressed as Veldt-cornet.
</p>

<p>
"A prisoner, Veldt-cornet," said the
Boer.
</p>

<p>
The officer rubbed his eyes and said
somewhat sleepily, "A rooinek, Maartens?"
</p>

<p>
"He is an Englishman, I think, Veldt-cornet,"
answered the Boer; but no amount of
questioning could elicit from Jack his proper
name and place of residence.  If this were
part of Christian Uys's commando, his identity
would soon be discovered, and then good-bye
to life itself.
</p>

<p>
"Keep an eye on him, Maartens," said the
veldt-cornet, with a yawn; and the officer
rolling himself up in his blanket, sank back on
the veldt, and was soon wrapped in a profound
slumber.
</p>

<p>
The fire was now burning low&mdash;a lucky
circumstance for Jack Lovat, or his wounded
condition would have been seen, and
unwelcome inquiries made.
</p>

<p>
"Lie down and rest, youngster," said the
Boer sentry; and Jack obeyed.
</p>

<p>
Our hero's mind was now running on horses,
but that another chance of escape would present
itself seemed impossible.
</p>

<p>
Dawn would soon break, and he knew that
if the other portion of Christian Uys's
commando should come up, all would be over,
and a Mauser bullet would end his cares
and sufferings.
</p>

<p>
Several of the Boers were awake and
glancing at Jack with looks of wonderment.
Their curiosity, however, had evidently been
appeased by Maartens, and seated round the
smouldering embers of the fire, they began
to converse in low whispers, and Jack
overheard such words as "drift," "kloof," and
"schantze"; and when the words "New
Zealanders" were pronounced he knew that the
patrol were on the look-out for the Auckland
Rangers.
</p>

<p>
The cold was intense, and Jack began to
shiver violently.  One of the Boers seeing this,
kindly handed our hero a blanket and told him
to make himself comfortable.
</p>

<p>
An hour before dawn the whole party were
astir, and the grateful aroma of freshly made
coffee filled Jack's nostrils.
</p>

<p>
Additional fires had been lighted, and over
these several Boers were busily engaged in
grilling strips of biltong.
</p>

<p>
Jack's appetite for the moment had left him,
and he turned away from the roughly cooked
beef which was offered him.  The odour was
nauseating to Jack's hypersensitive olfactory
nerves.
</p>

<p>
He did not, however, refuse the coffee,
which imparted a welcome warmth to his chilled
frame.
</p>

<p>
The veldt-cornet was wide enough awake
now, and after the hastily prepared meal had
been discussed, he turned to Jack, whom he
cross-examined very closely.
</p>

<p>
"You come from this neighbourhood?"
queried the veldt-cornet.
</p>

<p>
Jack shook his head; and the Boer officer
went on&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Have you been serving against us in the
field?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not a soldier," answered Jack.  "I
am a settler's son.  All that we desire is peace;
we want nothing more."
</p>

<p>
The veldt-cornet laughed as he said, "There
will soon be peace, boy, when all the rooineks
have been kicked into the sea.  You are
wounded, I see.  Where did you receive your
wound?  In a fight?"
</p>

<p>
"It is nothing&mdash;a mere scratch I managed
to get in an accident," replied Jack, assuming
a cheerful air.
</p>

<p>
"Then you will join us, youngster?" queried
the Boer leader.
</p>

<p>
"I would rather be excused," answered Jack.
"I want to get to Springbokfontein."
</p>

<p>
"You will reach there in good time," said
the veldt-cornet.  "In the interval you might
do worse than see a little service under the
vierkeleur.  What say you?  We can give
you a mount and a rifle.  Maartens, how are
we off for horses?"
</p>

<p>
Maartens shrugged his shoulders as he
replied, "We have a couple of led horses,
Veldt-cornet, the roan mare, and the young
horse."
</p>

<p>
"Then let him take the roan," observed the
officer.
</p>

<p>
"By the way, youngster," he continued,
"have you seen anything of a troop of
rooineks&mdash;New Zealanders&mdash;in the district?"
</p>

<p>
"I understand that some are in this part of
the country," answered Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you will go along with us, you shall
see them before long," said the veldt-cornet.
"We want to catch a fellow named Morton.
The commandant will give a thousand pounds
for the fellow, dead or alive."
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed to himself as he thought of the
New Zealander's narrow escape, and wondered
what the latter was doing, and whether he had
made good his escape from the Diamond
Valley or not.
</p>

<p>
"You know Springbokfontein, I suppose?"
asked the Boer officer, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"I have been there several times," was
Jack's reply.
</p>

<p>
"Is the place strongly guarded?" queried
the veldt-cornet, who was a namesake and
relative of President Steyn.
</p>

<p>
"You ask me a question that I cannot
answer," replied Jack.  "There is certainly
a town guard, but whether they are any
good or not is more than I can say.  However,
you had better try your luck against the
town."
</p>

<p>
"That is just what we are going to do, after
we get hold of these New Zealanders.  You
know the Bank at Springbokfontein?" queried
Steyn.
</p>

<p>
"I know very little about banks," answered
Jack somewhat brusquely; and then he nearly
made an ass of himself by blurting out the
fact that his father had been robbed of five
hundred pounds intended for deposit in the
bank under discussion.
</p>

<p>
"It is said that a hundred thousand
sovereigns are reposing in the Bank," said
the veldt-cornet, with a laugh, "mostly
belonging to the people who asked us to
come to their help and then showed the white
feather."
</p>

<p>
"White flag, did you say?" asked Jack
grimly.  "I thought only Boers were addicted
to that practice."
</p>

<p>
"Have a care, youngster," said Steyn
warningly, as he tapped the butt end of
his rifle with a meaning glance in his eyes.
"It is the rooineks, not Free Staters or
Transvaalers."
</p>

<p>
Jack felt that metaphorically speaking he
was putting his foot in it, and intimated he was
only having a joke.
</p>

<p>
"A delicate subject to joke about, youngster,"
observed Steyn.  "You know the countryside?"
he added.
</p>

<p>
"Not this immediate neighbourhood," replied Jack.
</p>

<p>
"And what takes you so far from home?"
queried the veldt-cornet.
</p>

<p>
"We settlers hunt sometimes," suggested Jack.
</p>

<p>
"But not without weapons.  Where is your
rifle?" demanded Steyn.
</p>

<p>
"The country is under martial law," replied Jack.
</p>

<p>
"The rooineks' law," sneered Steyn.
</p>

<p>
"As you say," observed Jack diplomatically.
</p>

<p>
"You mean that you have lost or mislaid
your rifle?" queried Steyn.
</p>

<p>
"I had an adventure with lions," said Jack.
"I&mdash;&mdash;"  Our hero hesitated, and then added,
"I will join you."
</p>

<p>
"Spoken like a man!" cried the veldt-cornet.
"Maartens, the roan mare and a Mauser for
the youngster, before he changes his mind."
</p>

<p>
"The mare is quiet, I trust?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"You shall try her.  See, it is nearing
daybreak.  At sunrise you shall satisfy
yourself as to your mount."
</p>

<p>
The sounds of clattering hoofs arrested the
officer's attention, and a Boer presently rode up.
</p>

<p>
"The veldt-cornet?" inquired the new-comer.
</p>

<p>
"I am here," said Steyn.  "You have ridden
over from the commandant, Du Plessis?"
</p>

<p>
"I have ridden on the spur, Veldt-cornet,"
answered the Boer.  "Du Boisson was stabbed
last night by a young rooinek whom we caught
yesterday, just as you marched out of camp.
The rooinek has escaped, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He is here," said Steyn, and he looked
round for Jack; but the ostrich farmer's son
was already on the roan mare's back and
scudding like the wind down the donga.
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" cried Steyn.  "No, don't shoot;
it might bring a hornet's nest around our ears.
He has gone in an opposite direction to that
from which we expect the New Zealanders.
Maartens, you were too premature in bringing
the mare;" and Maartens had the good
sense to look abashed.
</p>

<p>
"He is the rooinek who killed Du Boisson,"
said Du Plessis.  "Van Donnop knows him
well.  He is the son of an ostrich farmer named
Lovat."
</p>

<p>
"The man from whom the five hundred
sovereigns were taken?" exclaimed Steyn
excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"The same, Veldt-cornet," replied the Boer
scout.
</p>

<p>
"And it was at this brat's father's farm
where some of our men were repulsed only
two nights ago," said Steyn, with growing
excitement.  "I wish Maartens had shot him
as he lay on the veldt."
</p>

<p>
"I had rather he belonged to us, Veldt-cornet,"
observed Maartens.  "He is a slim
youth, and, if his heart had been in the right
place, would have been of great service to
the cause."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, maybe, Maartens," growled the
officer.  "Now that he has got away, he
will alarm the whole country."
</p>

<p>
"Van Donnop says that the New Zealanders
will come this way," said Maartens, pointing to
the upper end of the donga.  "The rooinek
must move on his left flank, as the country is
very broken and cut up.  However, you will
see.  We shall catch them in a trap, and then
march straight for Springbokfontein and Port
Nolloth.  I am quite right."
</p>

<p>
"You always had good sense, Maartens; but
if we catch this young Lovat, a bullet will be
too good for him; a piece of stout rope and a
tree&mdash;the aasvogel shall do the rest.  The men
have all breakfasted?"
</p>

<p>
"All have had coffee and biltong, Veldt-cornet,"
answered Maartens, who was acting as
second in command of the patrol, which as
things went, might have been termed a
reconnaissance in force.
</p>

<p>
Let us follow the fortunes of Jack Lovat, the
daring boy-fighter of the Kopje Farm.
</p>

<p>
While the veldt-cornet was talking to
Burgher Du Plessis, Maartens brought up the
roan mare, and acting on the spur of the
moment, Jack, while pretending to examine
the horse's head-gear, sprang on its back, and
as narrated, sped like the wind to the other
end of the donga.
</p>

<p>
His breath came hard and fast, and every
moment he expected being struck by a bullet.
He wondered what the sensation would be like
if a missile hit him, but luckily he was spared
the experience.
</p>

<p>
No sooner did he reach the entrance to the
donga than something seemed to whisper to
him, "You must keep to the left, for there lie
home and safety."
</p>

<p>
The mare was a gallant one, and full of
mettle, for with long strides she rushed gamely
forward, widening the gap between Jack and
her late owner.
</p>

<p>
The ostrich farmer's son never drew rein
until a couple of miles distant from the Boer
laager, when he eased up, and after glancing
round, dismounted&mdash;taking care to retain a
firm grasp on the reins.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven, I am free once more,"
said Jack to himself.  "And now for the Kopje
Farm!"
</p>

<p>
Several landmarks seemed familiar to him.
One of the kopjes he remembered as being
a spot much favoured by baboons, ugly grinning
apes that lived in the caves with which
the kopje abounded.
</p>

<p>
The Kopje Farm he knew lay some few
miles to the south of the hill, so he moved
forward towards a donga which skirted the
right base of the kopje.
</p>

<p>
His attention was arrested by a sight which
sent the blood rushing to his heart, causing a
choking sensation that almost stifled him.
</p>

<p>
About a mile distant he discerned a troop
of mounted men advancing in his direction.
</p>

<p>
"They are Boers!" ejaculated Jack aloud.
"I've escaped from one fire only to fall into
another."
</p>

<p>
He was in the middle of the donga when he
first caught sight of the strangers who were
advancing over the open veldt.
</p>

<p>
Jack watched the progress of the horsemen,
who suddenly halted.
</p>

<p>
Evidently a fresh order had been given, for
presently they wheeled to the right and
moved on in an oblique direction.
</p>

<p>
"They are going straight towards Langeman's
Nek," thought Jack; but his quick eyes
detected something he had not seen before.
</p>

<p>
"They are our fellows!" cried he,&mdash;"the
Auckland Rangers.  I know them by the
feathers in their slouch-hats;" and without
more ado he rode forward, and clearing the
donga, galloped forward at full speed in the
direction of the horsemen.

CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
THE AMBUSH
</h3>

<p>
When Jack and his two companions did not
return to the Kopje Farm, much speculation
was indulged in as to their fate by the men
of the Auckland Rangers.  It had been the
intention of Major Salkeld to saddle up in the
afternoon, but the non-appearance of Morton
altered his plans, and a couple of hours were
spent in reconnoitring by his scouts, but
without success.
</p>

<p>
One of the Kaffirs asserted that he had
heard shots fired in the Diamond Valley about
noontide, but this statement led to no
elucidation of the mystery connected with the
disappearance of Trooper Morton and Jack.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lovat, too, was uneasy.  He knew that
his son possessed an adventurous nature, for
Jack during his hunting expeditions had been
several times absent from home for a couple of
days at a time, but it had always been with
his father's permission.
</p>

<p>
Accommodation for the troopers was provided
in various parts of the farm buildings,
while Major Salkeld partook of Mr. Lovat's
hospitality in the farmer's private apartments.
</p>

<p>
Sentries were posted at various points
around the farm, and with anxious hearts the
ostrich farmer and his wife retired to rest, but
not to sleep.  Mr. Lovat's fear was that the
three missing ones had fallen into the hands
of the Boers.
</p>

<p>
Dawn at last broke on the veldt.  The
night had passed without any alarms, and the
quietness and solitude seemed oppressive.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lovat and the major were early astir,
the former directing the "boys" in the serving
out of corn to the troopers' horses, while the
latter looked after his men.
</p>

<p>
The little force were able to replenish their
bandoliers from the ample stores which
Mr. Lovat had in stock, so that each man now
carried two hundred rounds of cartridges.
</p>

<p>
Soon after dawn, the troopers moved off,
after taking a hearty farewell of their host and
hostess, not forgetting Mary, with whom the
Irregulars left many little mementos in the
shape of gold coins of the realm, and which
they insisted on her accepting&mdash;although
against her father's wish.
</p>

<p>
Their route would be by Langeman's Nek,
a defile to the west of Rheni Kop, and Major
Salkeld had promised his men some fighting
before they joined the bulk of the regiment.
</p>

<p>
The road was very difficult, and progress
consequently was slow.  Scouts were thrown
forward in front and on the flanks, but for a
few miles nothing unusual occurred.
</p>

<p>
The advance guard was suddenly seen to
halt and dismount.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards, one of the scouts
signalled, "Halt! remain where you are.  We
are falling back."
</p>

<p>
Major Salkeld instantly halted his men, and
ordered them to see to the magazines of their
rifles.
</p>

<p>
The four scouts in advance presently came
riding in, and the leader at once made his
report to the major.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," began the trooper, "I fancy we shall
see some fighting before long.  The country
in front is admirably suited for an ambush, and
a horseman is rapidly approaching.  Look,
here he comes!"
</p>

<p>
Round the bend of a kopje, some seven
hundred yards away, a horseman was seen
galloping at full speed towards them.
</p>

<p>
The major at once placed his glasses to his
eyes and gazed earnestly through them, after
which he rode a little ahead.
</p>

<p>
"He is quite a youngster," exclaimed the
major.  "Why, it is the son of our worthy friend,
the ostrich farmer, up at the Kopje Farm;"
and the next moment Jack Lovat pulled up,
mounted on a beautiful mare, which was flecked
with foam.
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" gasped Jack, for he was almost
breathless, "you are ambushed.  Nearly two
hundred Boers are waiting in Langeman's Nek
for you.  Go back at once, sir."
</p>

<p>
Jack's shirt and jacket were stained with
blood, and Major Salkeld with some anxiety
asked, "But you are wounded, my boy.  What
does this mean, and where do you come
from?"
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, sir," said Jack, "but we must
retire into the donga.  The Boers will soon be
covering me with their rifles.  If you had gone
much farther, all of you would have been
killed!"
</p>

<p>
The major wheeled  round, and followed by
Jack Lovat, returned leisurely to where his
men, mounted on their horses, were awaiting
him.
</p>

<p>
"Right about!" shouted the officer; "by fours
retire to the donga;" and the troopers obeyed.
</p>

<p>
The retirement was effected in perfect order,
without a shot being fired by the unseen enemy.
Then the troop was halted, and Jack Lovat
told his story in a few simple words.
</p>

<p>
The major opened his eyes in amazement
as Jack narrated his adventures during the
previous day and the past night.
</p>

<p>
"And you say that Morton is shut up in a
cave in the Diamond Valley?" asked the
officer.
</p>

<p>
"He was there yesterday afternoon, sir,"
replied Jack, "and I'm going to him as soon as
I can.  The Boers bound his ankles with wet
hide.  He may have been able to get out and
crawl a little way, but I'm afraid not."
</p>

<p>
"And this commando of Boers, where is it?"
demanded the major.
</p>

<p>
"The main body was about half a dozen
miles from here last night, and a lot of burghers
are holding Langeman's Nek, waiting for you
now.  I'm awfully hungry.  Can you give me
anything to eat?'
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, my lad," cried the major cheerily;
and he took from his own haversack some
sandwiches Mrs. Lovat had made specially for
him, and handed them to Jack, who ate them
with great relish.
</p>

<p>
For a few moments the major was undecided
what to do; but after a little deliberation, he
ordered his men to dismount.  That done, he
despatched a couple of scouts to the mouth of
the donga.
</p>

<p>
The donga in which the troopers were now
posted was about half a mile in length, and
admirably situated for defence, if held by a fairly
strong party.  In the centre the ground, mostly
of a rocky nature, was much broken, affording
shelter for twice the number of men now under
Major Salkeld's command, and it was towards
this part that the officer determined to retreat.
Jack's first inquiries naturally were about the
inmates of the Kopje Farm, and he felt relieved
when the major assured him that everything
was right at the old homestead.
</p>

<p>
"One of the Kaffirs is missing, though," said
the officer.  "I forget his name.  Symonds,"
turning to an officer, "what is the name of
the nigger who went off soon after sunset last
night, and had not turned up this morning
when we left?"
</p>

<p>
"Moses, I think it is, sir," answered the
trooper.
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat stared somewhat rudely at the
Irregular and said, "I thought as much!  We
had him from Van Donnop's.  The beggar
deserves shooting."
</p>

<p>
Moses was the only shady character in
Mr. Lovat's establishment.  Before the outbreak of
the war, Moses, a Kaffir of immense strength
and stature, had been a most exemplary character;
but until news of the small disaster to the
British in the armoured-train incident at
Kraipan reached the remote district of Orangefontein,
Moses on various occasions had asked
permission to visit Van Donnop's farm,
ostensibly for the purpose of seeing a negress
employed by the Dutch farmer, and&mdash;Mrs. Lovat
possessing as she did a sentimental
nature&mdash;his requests were always acceded to.
</p>

<p>
"And so Moses has left the Kopje Farm,
sir?" queried Jack.  "It looks somewhat fishy.
Upon my word, it seems as though Moses had
some hand in the disappearance of my father's
money."
</p>

<p>
The New Zealanders reached the broken
ground and dismounted, and Major Salkeld
awaited the appearance of his scouts, who were
now hidden by a bend in the donga.
</p>

<p>
Presently the 'pip-pop' of Mauser fire was
heard in the direction of Langeman's Nek,
and the scouts bending low in their saddles,
came at a rattling pace towards the place where
their comrades were grimly and silently
awaiting events.
</p>

<p>
One of the scouts, Burnand by name, had
a ghastly expression on his face, and it was
evident that he had been severely wounded,
when he dismounted from his horse, as he
tottered and fell on the ground.
</p>

<p>
"A little water, sir, if you please," he gasped,
looking at his riding-breeches, which were
drenched with blood.  "I've been hit.  Take
my bandolier, for I'm&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The trooper never finished the sentence, for
when a water-bottle was being held to his lips,
he gave a sigh, and died.  He had been hit by
a bullet in the stomach.
</p>

<p>
"Your report, Fielding, quick," said the
major, addressing the other scout.
</p>

<p>
"The enemy are closing in on the mouth of
the donga, sir," said the trooper.  "If a dozen
men are at once hurried forward, they may be
able to check them."
</p>

<p>
"Now, men," cried the major, "I want no
volunteers; there is no time for that.  Sergeant
Oliphant, pick twenty men quickly.  The rest
will remain here."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sir," replied the sergeant, a
quiet-looking man of thirty; and in a few seconds the
non-commissioned officer, much in the same
way as schoolboys pick a team of cricketers,
selected twenty New Zealanders, who, headed
by Major Salkeld and the sergeant, moved
forward at a gallop towards the mouth of the
donga overlooking Langeman's Nek.
</p>

<p>
"No; stay where you are," said the
officer in answer to Jack Lovat's appeal.
Major Salkeld's command to our hero was
so peremptory that Jack was obliged to
obey.
</p>

<p>
"Get your horses into shelter," were the
major's last words to a corporal.  "Possibly
we may have to retire to this spot."
</p>

<p>
At breakneck speed Major Salkeld and his
men hurried to the mouth of the donga.  A
volley of bullets, which luckily emptied no
saddles, was the welcome they received.
</p>

<p>
On each side of the donga stretched low
ranges of kopjes, diminutive in size, but offering
good shelter from fire which might be directed
from the donga.
</p>

<p>
The major at once dismounted his men,
and four troopers led back the horses to a
distance of some two hundred paces, on the
instructions of the officer.
</p>

<p>
The remaining troopers fell prone on the
ground, after which they crawled forward,
sheltering themselves behind big stones and
mimosa scrub.
</p>

<p>
"We cannot afford to lose a cartridge, men,"
cried the major.  "Every bullet must find its
mark, or we are done for."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sir," muttered more than one
man; "we'll see to that;" and with strained
vision they glanced along the kopjes, from
which little spurts of flame occasionally
issued&mdash;heralds of the coming storm.
</p>

<p>
"These beggars know how to fight," muttered
the major.  "No wonder our men were shot
down in such numbers at Magersfontein."
</p>

<p>
The Boers blazed away at the tiny handful
of men belonging to the Rangers, with
scarcely any reply on the latter's part.  The
Irregulars were well up in the art of fire
discipline, and did not mean to waste a
cartridge.  Occasionally a slouch-hat peeped
from its hiding-place on a kopje, and the
report of a Lee-Enfield testified to the
quickness of eyesight possessed by the men from
Maoriland.
</p>

<p>
The second casualty among the New Zealanders
happened to a trooper named Jordan, a
miner, possessed of an adventurous spirit, who,
spotting an excellent target in the shape of a
Boer whose head and shoulders were exposed,
raised himself on his elbows in order to get a
better sight, and as he fired, received a couple
of bullets in his brain.  Without an exclamation,
the unfortunate New Zealander rolled over on
his side&mdash;a dead man.
</p>

<p>
The spurts of flame from the kopjes came
nearer, until at last a terrible cross fire was
poured on the isolated position held by the few
Irregulars.
</p>

<p>
"We can do no good here," said Major
Salkeld in a voice loud enough to be heard by
all his men; "we must fall back on the others.
What say you, Sergeant Oliphant?"
</p>

<p>
A braver man than the sergeant never put
on putties, and he answered, "Quite right, sir;
we must get back to the other fellows;" and the
order was given by the major to retire beyond
the bend, where the horses were being held.
</p>

<p>
Luckily the long veldt grass concealed
their movements, or the New Zealanders would
have suffered more heavily than they did.  As
it was, during the short retirement, three men
were hit&mdash;one killed outright, and the others
dangerously wounded.
</p>

<p>
"We cannot leave these men here," said
Major Salkeld; so the stricken troopers were
picked up and carried to where the odd men
were standing with the horses.  The rifles
which the wounded and dead had dropped when
they fell were not forgotten.
</p>

<p>
The Irregulars were now out of the line of
the enemy's fire, and no time was lost in
retreating to where Jack Lovat and the remainder of
the Irregulars were posted.
</p>

<p>
One of the wounded men succumbed shortly
after reaching the place of shelter, so that the
morning's fatalities up to the present totalled
three out of a very slender force.
</p>

<p>
The horses, none of which had been hit,
were picketed in a little ravine, and three men
told off as guard, after which Major Salkeld
saw to the defence.
</p>

<p>
An unpleasant thought flashed through
his mind, and the brain message resolved
itself into the question, "Are we in a death-trap?"
</p>

<p>
The sides of the donga were precipitous,
and clad here and there with geraniums and
heath of various species.  Quartz rock of
almost snowy whiteness peeped out, forming
a striking contrast to the vivid red of the
geraniums and the brown mottled surface of
the heaths.
</p>

<p>
"Oliphant," said the major, addressing his
sergeant, "do you think it politic for us to
retire straight through the donga by the way
we came, and retrace our steps to the Kopje
Farm?"
</p>

<p>
A grim look was on the sergeant's face as
he replied, "It would be, sir, if we could
manage to do it."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Oliphant?" queried
the officer.  "There will not be the slightest
difficulty in the way, only I don't quite like
the idea of falling back.  It is against our
traditions, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I thoroughly understand what you mean,
sir," answered the sergeant; "but I am very
much mistaken if even now both ends of the
donga are not closed against us.  I believe we
are in a death-trap, sir."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't say much for our scouting,"
muttered Major Salkeld; after which he added
aloud, "Get the men ready to start, Oliphant.
Poor Mason must be left for a time at least."
</p>

<p>
Two wounded troopers were in a bad plight.
One had been shot through the lungs, but still
lived, while the other, more fortunate, was
suffering from a broken arm.
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat when he realised the true state
of affairs at once volunteered to remain behind
with the trooper who was lying at death's door,
but the gallant lad's offer was firmly refused by
Major Salkeld.
</p>

<p>
The latter was in a terrible dilemma.  If he
and his little force left their present place of
shelter, and a section of the Boers had crept
round to the other end of the donga, it would
mean almost certain death, or at the best
surrender, and the men riding in the ranks of
the Auckland Rangers had made a solemn vow
when they landed in the country never to be
taken alive.
</p>

<p>
The major made up his mind.  He would
remain; so he set his men to work to intrench
themselves, after which he despatched scouts
to each end of the donga.
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat this time would not be denied,
and along with Sergeant Oliphant made his
way to the mouth of the donga leading to the
Kopje Farm.
</p>

<p>
Two hundred yards from the entrance they
dismounted and picketed their horses.  Then
on hands and knees they began crawling
towards the mouth of the donga.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you have the safety catch of your
rifle on," whispered Oliphant.  "We must have
no accidents."
</p>

<p>
"It is all right, Sergeant," replied Jack.
</p>

<p>
This part of the donga was covered with
long veldt grass, nearly a foot high, and
although it somewhat impeded their
movements, it screened them fairly well from
observation.
</p>

<p>
No signs of Boers could be seen, although
Jack and his companion carefully scrutinised
the ridges on both sides of the donga.
</p>

<p>
At length a peculiar noise was heard.  It
was something between a whistle and a cry.
The two scouts fell prone and lay still.
Presently Jack whispered, "See, Sergeant, on
your right front.  The place is swarming with
Boers."
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had he finished speaking when the
report of a volley rang through the donga.
The bullets whistled harmlessly over the heads
of the Colonial and his young friend.
Involuntarily Jack turned his head.  The two
horses lately ridden by himself and his
companion were lying stretched on the
ground.
</p>

<p>
For a few minutes both lay still, not daring
to move a limb, until a fierce fusillade broke
out at the other end of the donga.  This
decided the sergeant, and he whispered, "We
must get back, boy.  We are hemmed in, but
I think it best to fight it out together."
</p>

<p>
And so thought Jack.  Although only a few
hundred yards from their friends, it took the
pair nearly half an hour to regain the
intrenchment.  They crawled on their hands, knees,
and stomachs, wriggling like serpents in the
long grass, and although both had several near
escapes from being hit, they did not receive a
scratch.
</p>

<p>
Things looked very black at the intrenchment.
Three men were already lying in a
last long sleep, while more than a dozen had
been wounded.
</p>

<p>
The little band of New Zealanders was
suffering from a heavy frontal fire, to which
at any time might be added a terrible flank
one.
</p>

<p>
Several horses had been killed, and the
moans of the wounded men and their cries for
water were heartrending.  Major Salkeld, with
a white face streaked with blood from a wound
in the head, looked as grim and determined as
ever.
</p>

<p>
His men had not wasted a cartridge, for they
knew that the exhaustion of their bandoliers
meant death or surrender.
</p>

<p>
One young trooper, Coke by name, who
through love of adventure and fighting had
thrown up a splendid appointment in the Bank
of Australasia, received a mortal wound in the
stomach as he slightly rose to twist round his
bandolier.
</p>

<p>
With a blanched face, he turned to Major
Salkeld and gasped, "I'm done for, sir!  Take
these;" and with great difficulty and increased
agony he wrenched off his bandolier and
handed it to the officer.
</p>

<p>
"One drop of water, before I die!" muttered
the poor lad; but water there was none within
fifty yards, and the open must be crossed before
that could be obtained.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going for some water," said Jack
Lovat, laying down his rifle, and heedless of
the officer's remonstrance, Jack coolly collected
half a dozen water-bottles, and leaving the
shelter of the intrenchment, ran forward in
search of the precious fluid.  Thoughts of
danger possibly entered his mind, but the
desire to alleviate the sufferings of his
wounded comrades was paramount.
</p>

<p>
The peculiar 'phit-phit' of Mauser bullets
whisked round his head, but he ran steadily
on, untouched by the nickel messengers of
death.  Then the fire suddenly ceased, and
Jack filled the water-bottles and returned to
the intrenchment.
</p>

<p>
"My lad," cried Major Salkeld, "you
deserve a hundred Victoria Crosses.  I will
see, if we get safely out of this, that you shall
not go unrewarded."
</p>

<p>
A white flag fluttered in the breeze not
three hundred yards away, and a couple of
Boers holding the signal of truce, advanced.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I go and meet them, sir?" asked
Oliphant.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do," replied Major Salkeld; "see
what they want.  But no surrender.  That
is our motto.  They must not see our weakness."
</p>

<p>
The sergeant stepped forward and met the
Boers half-way.  He had heard plenty of tales
concerning white-flag treachery, but he knew
that if anything happened to him, his fall
would be speedily avenged, for a dozen deadly
levelled rifles in the intrenchment would speak
with fatal effect.
</p>

<p>
"We demand your surrender," said one of
the Boers to Oliphant, a heavily-bearded man,
with a by no means unpleasant cast of
countenance.  "There has been enough bloodshed,
and you have proved yourselves brave
men.  You have no chance, and will surely all
be shot down.  Veldt-cornet Steyn wishes me
to express his admiration of your fighting
qualities.  Are you the officer in charge of
this detachment?"
</p>

<p>
"I am only a subordinate," answered
Oliphant.  "I cannot make or even discuss
terms."
</p>

<p>
"Then return to your commanding officer,
and tell him that if his force does not surrender
within ten minutes, firing will be resumed,
and then God help you."
</p>

<p>
Oliphant bowed, and returned to the
intrenchment.
</p>

<p>
Major Salkeld on hearing the sergeant's
narration of the brief interview with the Boers,
exclaimed, "We do not surrender.  Not an
Aucklander yet has been captured by the
enemy.  We will fight to a finish."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, the Boers again opened
fire upon the brave New Zealanders, now sadly
diminished in number.

CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
THE RESCUE
</h3>

<p>
We must now return to Trooper Morton,
whom we left bound in a cave in Diamond
Valley.  His wound was a painful one, and
having lost a quantity of blood, he naturally
felt somewhat weak.
</p>

<p>
The Boers had taken good care to secure
his ankles.  The hide with which they were
bound was tied and knotted while wet, and,
quickly drying, caused great pain by its
contraction.
</p>

<p>
He raised himself into a sitting posture and
began fumbling with the hide rope.  He might
as well have tried to snap bands of wrought
iron.  He was hungry as well, so he turned to
the strip of biltong which the Boers had
thrown to him when they departed.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose they take me for a cannibal,"
he muttered, looking at the dried ox-flesh.
"However, I'll see what it is made of.  I
daresay I shall need all the strength I can
muster before I reach my troop&mdash;if ever I do.
I really don't want to make another acquaintance,
while alone, with these beggars."
</p>

<p>
The biltong proved palatable, and Morton,
possessing a healthy digestion and not being
fastidious, made a satisfying meal of the
unaccustomed food.
</p>

<p>
His next action was to crawl out of the
cave, and with some difficulty he made his
way to a little rivulet that ran along the base
of one of the sides of the donga.  In the bed
of the stream were pebbles of various sizes, and
after assuaging his thirst, he began to search
for a sharp-edged stone.
</p>

<p>
For some minutes he was unsuccessful, but
at last perseverance brought its reward, and he
discovered a triangular-shaped piece of quartz.
With this he began sawing at the rope, but he
found the hide tougher than he had bargained
for.
</p>

<p>
He hacked at his fetters until darkness set
in, and by that time had only succeeded in
severing a single strand.  Two more must
be cut before he could regain his freedom.
</p>

<p>
He resolved to snatch a few hours' sleep, so
he crawled to a depression, a couple of hundred
yards distant from the cave, and lay down.
The night was bitterly cold, and the Southern
Cross gleamed brightly above him.  At last
he fell asleep, and when he awoke streaks of
yellow light were shooting upwards into the
sky from the eastern horizon.
</p>

<p>
He again set to work on the hide rope, and
before the sun had reached the point midway
between the zenith and horizon was a free man.
His ankles were sore and swollen, and taking
off his stockings, he bathed his feet in the clear
water of the stream, after which he felt better.
</p>

<p>
Then his mind turned to the pebble hidden
within the recesses of his breast pocket.  He
took it out and examined it with interest and
more than ordinary care.
</p>

<p>
"A few more like this," he muttered, "and
I shall be able to open the finest shop in
Auckland."
</p>

<p>
His knowledge of precious stones, and more
especially diamonds, told him that he had
secured a magnificent specimen of crystallised
carbon.  He retraced his steps to the place
where he had found the diamond, passing on
his way the dead body of poor Pete, and
although his only implement was the three-edged
piece of quartz, he was fortunate enough
to find four additional stones, not so large as
his first discovery, but still of great value.
</p>

<p>
Sounds of distant rifle-firing fell upon his
ears, desultory at first, then in volleys.  Like
Jack Lovat, Morton had a pair of keen eyes
and ears, and was well able to find his way
about, so he soon located the scene of
fighting.
</p>

<p>
He knew that the firing proceeded from an
opposite direction to that of the Kopje Farm,
and came to the conclusion that warfare was
going on in that particular quarter.  He would
make the best of his way to Mr. Lovat's
farmstead, where, if his comrades had departed,
he could obtain a mount, and possibly a pair of
boots.  After that, he would try to rejoin his
troop.
</p>

<p>
Quick locomotion was out of the question,
for his feet were already blistered and bleeding,
from contact with camel-thorns and pieces of
jagged rock.
</p>

<p>
He was making for the summit of the kopje
overlooking the farm, when a couple of Kaffirs
suddenly appeared, and came running towards
him.  The natives halted, but Morton beckoned
to them, and after some display of hesitancy,
they came up.
</p>

<p>
The trooper was instantly recognised by the
Kaffirs.  They proved to be two of Mr. Lovat's
"boys," Simon and Daniel.
</p>

<p>
Simon, who was a little fellow of singularly
grotesque appearance, called out, "Baas, don't
go to de Kopje Farm.  It is in de hands ob
bad Boers.  Dey hab killed all de oder 'boys'
'cept Dan'l an' myself."
</p>

<p>
"What!" exclaimed Morton, "have our men
left the farm?"
</p>

<p>
"Dey went dis mornin', baas," answered
Simon.  "Dere be hundreds ob de Boers.
Dan'l ah' me got away through de bush, or we
would hab been murdered as well.  If only
Baas Jack had been at home, dis would not
hab happened; but de old baas no show fight,
and de Boers are now up at de Kopje, eatin'
an' drinkin' eberyding in the place."
</p>

<p>
"Hold hard, my dear fellow!  Not quite so
fast," said Morton; "you talk too quickly.  I
want you to tell me what has happened."
</p>

<p>
"Well, baas," replied the Kaffir, "Moses an'
Pete and Baas Jack hab been missin' sin'
yesterday, an' the missis and little missis hab
been crying all de night an' day too.  I know
your face, baas.  I saw you yesterday before
Baas Jack an' Pete went away, an' den Moses
sneaked away; an' oh, baas, dings are in a bad
way at de Kopje Farm.  De Boers hab taken
Bessie, an' Juno, an' Jess, an'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Simon Peter, or whatever your
name is, you are spinning too long a yarn for
me.  Just answer me one or two questions.
First, when did the Boers arrive at Mr. Lovat's?"
</p>

<p>
With the peculiarity habitual to Kaffirs,
Simon began counting his fingers in a rapid
manner, after which he replied, "Dey came
two hours after de captain an' his men saddled
up an' went away."
</p>

<p>
"How many Boers are at the Kopje
Farm?" queried Morton.  "Try and tell me
exactly."
</p>

<p>
Again the native's fingers began the counting
process.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" demanded Morton.
</p>

<p>
"I should say one hundred an' half dat
number, all men wid some led horses.  Dey
killed all de 'boys' 'cept Pete, Moses, Dan'l,
an' myself.  It was horrible; but de baas would
not fight, an' we got away.  But where are
your boots, baas?  Your feet dey are bleedin',
too, an' you look bad.  Wounded?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a trifle, 'boy'&mdash;not much," replied
Morton.  "Have you any arms with you&mdash;knives
or anything of that kind?"
</p>

<p>
Daniel, who was a forbidding-looking
Kaffir considerably over six feet in height,
pulled out a revolver from his trousers' pocket,
and handing it to the New Zealander, said,
"Dis belongs to Baas Jack, but I spec he is
dead."
</p>

<p>
Morton took the weapon in his hand and
examined it carefully.  The pistol was branded
with the mark of the British Small Arms
Company, and was new and of heavy calibre.
</p>

<p>
"Any cartridges?" queried Morton.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty ob dem, baas," answered Daniel,
producing a box which the trooper found
contained fifty rounds.  The Kaffir took the
cartridges from a shooting coat that had
evidently belonged to Mr. Lovat.
</p>

<p>
"You keep dat, baas," said Daniel, "if you
will let us go wid you.  We dare not go back
to de Kopje Farm.  I will now make you a
pair ob boots dat will be all right."
</p>

<p>
Before Morton could say a word, the Kaffir
plucked a number of large leaves from a shrub
of the plantain species, and within a very short
time, with the aid of a little string, had
manufactured a pair of presentable sandals&mdash;if
somewhat unshapely, at least comfortable.
</p>

<p>
"Now, baas," said Daniel, after he had
fitted on the foot-gear, "do de boots suit?
Dey will not last long, but better dan nothin'."
</p>

<p>
The New Zealander burst into a loud laugh,
despite the seriousness of his position, and
assured the Kaffir that he was delighted with
the boots.
</p>

<p>
"Will you 'boys' go with me to the Kopje
Farm?" asked he, as he rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
The eyes of both Kaffirs rolled in their
sockets, showing an unusual proportion of
white, and Simon, the loquacious one, said
with a splutter, "No, baas, a thousand times,
no.  Dan'l an' me likes a good fight, but a
sjambokking first, and shootin' de next minute,
don't suit dese two boys at all."
</p>

<p>
The strangely assorted trio, after Morton
had rested a few minutes, set off in the
direction of Orangefontein; Daniel, who knew
the country well, leading the way, while the
trooper and Simon followed in the rear.
</p>

<p>
Again Morton tackled his Kaffir companion
about the commando of Boers who had so
unexpectedly arrived at the Kopje Farm soon
after the departure of the New Zealanders.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say there was not the
slightest attempt to show fight when the Boers
arrived, Moses?"
</p>

<p>
"Dat is not my name, baas," replied the
Kaffir, with some heat.  "My name Simon.
Moses no good at all&mdash;always up at Van
Donnop's over de veldt; worse dan a Boer."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind what your name is, my good
fellow," observed the trooper.  "The Boers could
not come from the Kopje?"
</p>

<p>
"No, baas; no road dat way.  Dere be three
paths up to de farm&mdash;one straight from de valley,
an' de oders on what you call de right an' left
flanks.  De Boers came up on de left flank,
while your boys went away by de right.  We
first saw de Boers when dey were a long way off."
</p>

<p>
"But you said that the 'boys' with the
exception of yourselves had been killed.  What
makes you think that, Simon?"
</p>

<p>
"I dink nothin' at all about it, baas; I am
sure."  Here the Kaffir's eyes dilated widely.
"From our hiding-place in de bush, Dan'l an'
me saw one ob de 'boys' run into de ostrich
kraal.  A Boer ran after him an' shot him
down.  Den several oder shots were fired, and
we knows what dat means.  Den we see de
missis and de little missie wiping dere eyes wid
aprons.  Dis is a bad mornin' for us, baas."
</p>

<p>
"All right, 'boys,'" said Morton; "you go
along with me.  Have you any knives?"
</p>

<p>
Daniel produced an ugly-looking bowie knife
from a sheath which he had concealed inside
his somewhat scanty shirt, and held it up for
the white man's inspection.
</p>

<p>
"That will do," said the New Zealander.
"And now heigho! for Orangefontein and my
comrades of the Auckland Rangers!"
</p>

<p>
"Baas, can you tell me where young Baas
Jack is?" asked Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"He is a prisoner in the hands of the Boers,
my lad," answered Morton; "but I trust that
before long we shall come across him.  I think
I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The New Zealander halted, for the sound of
heavy rifle-fire could again be heard proceeding
from some place a few miles distant in the
right front.
</p>

<p>
"Fighting is going on," muttered Morton.
"Hang my ill-luck!  I am always out of the
show,"&mdash;a statement which was by no means
a correct one, seeing that Major Salkeld's
favourite scout had been in more skirmishes
probably than any other Irregular in the army.
</p>

<p>
Morton directed the two Kaffirs to look in
the direction whence the reports came; but the
keen vision of Simon and Daniel could detect
no flashes of flame, and in these days of
smokeless powder no haze hangs over scenes
of fight.
</p>

<p>
The country was wild in the extreme&mdash;granite-peaked
kopjes interlaced with innumerable
little dongas met the vision, gaze
where you would.  The kopjes, whose sides
and bases were clad with geraniums and heath
of various kinds, formed a glorious mosaic
against the steel-tinted blue of the African sky.
Everything in Nature was sublime, and stood
out in relief against the awful passions of men,
who were striving might and main to imbrue
their hands in their fellow-creatures' blood.
War has its romance, its temporary glitter, but
also its awful, black shadows in the shape of
untold physical and mental suffering, endured
by those who are compelled to serve under its
sombre flag.
</p>

<p>
The firing continued, and Trooper Morton,
irresistibly impelled by the sheer love of fighting
innate within him, veered out of the track
which Simon vehemently declared led to
Orangefontein.
</p>

<p>
The New Zealander's temporary foot-gear
had given way, and the two Kaffirs, while the
Irregular rested, went in search of fresh leaves,
taken from a bush of the plantain species, in
order to patch up the old or manufacture a new
pair of shoes.
</p>

<p>
The Kaffirs as a race are endowed with an
extraordinary range and quickness of vision,
and before Simon and Daniel had completed
their self-imposed task, the latter's keen eye
noted something on the horizon away to the
right, which for the moment disturbed his
peace of mind.
</p>

<p>
"Aasvogel, baas; dead people somewhere
near!" said the unsophisticated Kaffir, as he
advanced towards Morton, who was examining
his still swollen ankles.
</p>

<p>
The vulture of South Africa, like the steed
mentioned in Holy Writ, can smell the battle
from afar, and little did Morton imagine that
the hideous birds of prey were even now
hovering above the bodies of his late comrades,
proved friends in many a fight.
</p>

<p>
Farther away to the right still edged Morton.
His adventurous spirit was yearning to be in
the middle of the fray, but his Kaffir
companions were not imbued with the same
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Presently the trio struck the Orangefontein
road leading from Land Drift, and Morton
called a halt.  The biltong had given out, and
the Kaffirs were empty-handed.  Daniel,
however, was equal to the emergency.  His keen
eyes detected some white flowers growing on
the veldt, and his bowie knife was out in an
instant.
</p>

<p>
"Somethin' good to eat, baas," he said, as
he knelt down and began digging the ground
round the flower roots.  Presently he unearthed
what appeared to be ground nuts.  These he
handed to Morton, saying, "You try dese,
baas; dey are not bad eatin', an' you neber get
tired after you hab made a meal ob dem."
</p>

<p>
The trooper responded to Daniel's invitation,
and although the roots possessed a stronger
pungent odour than he liked, he assuaged his
hunger with them, and felt decidedly better
after his meal.
</p>

<p>
Simon and Daniel squatted themselves down
a few paces distant, for a Kaffir never partakes
of food with a white man, and Morton threw
himself on the veldt, on which at this part
heath grew very plentifully, and stretched
himself out.
</p>

<p>
Like the long continued rolling of thunder,
rifle-firing had been heard by the three
refugees, but all at once there was a fierce
crackle, followed by a few intermittent
shots&mdash;then silence.
</p>

<p>
"Baas!" cried Simon, running towards
Morton, "some horsemen are comin' dis way.
Dey be five."  The Kaffir held up his hand,
and continued, "Dey belong to you, baas.
Kaffirs can see a long way."
</p>

<p>
Morton's heart seemed to leap into his mouth
as he listened to Simon.  The news seemed too
good to be true.
</p>

<p>
"I can see nothing, Simon," said the trooper,
shading his eyes and looking down the valley,
in the direction pointed out by the Kaffir.
</p>

<p>
"Dere, baas, dere!" exclaimed Simon excitedly.
"Dey be comin' straight for us;" and at
last the New Zealander was able to distinguish
five moving figures, advancing at a rapid trot
towards them.
</p>

<p>
Morton was not exactly a religious man, but
he felt devoutly thankful when five minutes
later he found himself shaking hands with men
belonging to his regiment whom he had not
seen for a week.
</p>

<p>
They were scouts belonging to the B Troop
of the Rangers.  Rumours of a disaster to
Major Salkeld's troop had reached headquarters,
and instead of proceeding to Springbokfontein,
Colonel Malcolmson, the commandant of the
Rangers, with two Maxim guns and four
hundred men, was even now in search of the
missing troop.
</p>

<p>
Luckily the scouts had with them two led
horses, so that Morton was enabled to obtain a
mount.  Simon and Daniel declined the offer
made to them by Morton and backed up by
the scouts.  They would take their chance on
the veldt.  Morton knew that the blacks could
fight well when in laager, but they had very
little stomach for warfare when waged in the
open field.
</p>

<p>
Before parting with the Kaffirs, the horsemen
gave the two "boys" a supply of biscuit,
after which they left them.
</p>

<p>
The six New Zealanders proceeded towards
the spot where the firing had been heard.
Everything was now quiet, and as they
proceeded Morton detailed in a few words his
experiences since Major Salkeld had left the
main body.
</p>

<p>
"We are encamped in a valley about two
miles from here," said the sergeant of the
scouts, in answer to an interrogation by
Morton.  "Everything is in light order, and
we got word an hour ago that Major Salkeld
is in a tight corner, so we have been sent
round here to find out what we can, and report
at once.  I never in all my life saw such
country for manoeuvring in.  A fight may be
taking place not half a mile away, and you can
see nothing.  After what you have told us, I'm
afraid the major has not only lost the number
of his mess, but also that of his troop.
Hullo! here comes a fellow.  What does it mean?"
</p>

<p>
A few seconds later, a New Zealander, whose
horse was foam-flecked and panting with
exertion, rode up.
</p>

<p>
"Retire at once!" cried the new-comer.
"Ah, Morton! is it really you?  Glad to see
you, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
The speaker was a young lieutenant
temporarily attached to the New Zealanders
from the South African Light Horse.
</p>

<p>
"We have located the enemy, Sergeant,"
said the officer.  "Now, right about!" and
omitting the red tape, "trot! canter!" the seven
Britishers rode hard for the Colonials' camp.
</p>

<p>
Morton, handicapped though he was with his
plantain-leaf slipper&mdash;for by this time he had
only one left&mdash;was not the last man to reach the
camp of the New Zealanders.
</p>

<p>
The baggage and Maxims were left behind
under a strong guard, and Morton, who had no
difficulty in securing a pair of boots many sizes
too large for him, which of course was a
necessity, and a Lee-Enfield with its
accompanying complement in a fully loaded
bandolier, found himself once more on the
warpath.
</p>

<p>
The scouts, who undiscovered, had located
the Boers, led the way, and the force, nearly
three hundred strong, approached the valley
where Major Salkeld and his little band of
heroes for hours had fought against an
infuriated and stubborn foe.
</p>

<p>
An ominous silence reigned, but ahead on
the several kopjes, isolated bodies of horsemen,
few in number, could be seen retreating
westward.
</p>

<p>
"Is this to be a repetition of the Gordon
case?" asked Colonel Malcolmson of Captain
Bryan, a young Irish soldier of fortune, who
had served in Ladysmith during the early stages
of the war.  "Are we always to be too late?  I
pray that we may not be so now.  Major Salkeld
and his men are worth a king's ransom."
</p>

<p>
"I hope the present tense will hold good,
sir," said the Irishman grimly.  "The enemy
have evacuated their positions, which looks bad."
</p>

<p>
Things did look dark, for when the colonel
and his men arrived at the mouth of the donga
where Major Salkeld had been trapped,
thousands of empty cartridge-cases were found
strewing the ground.  The cases took the
form of five-chambered Mauser clips.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the donga, the relieving
force found the remnant of Major Salkeld's
troop, and tears came into the eyes of the
bronzed warriors as they gazed upon the
inanimate forms of the gallant lads from
Maoriland, stretched behind the little breastworks
formed by nature.
</p>

<p>
Some of the men still clutched their rifles,
fingers on triggers, with foreheads wrinkled
and savage-set lips.  These lay on their
stomachs, and had been hit while in the act
of taking aim.
</p>

<p>
Others had rolled over in their last dying
agony, and in their hands were clutched pieces
of veldt grass and gravel.
</p>

<p>
Were there any survivors?  Yes!  A
boyish form struggled to its feet and saluted
the colonel, as he stood gazing in awe and
wonderment at the little field of carnage.  The
form belonged to Jack Lovat, who merely said,
"I'm pleased you have come, sir.  We have
done the best we could."
</p>

<p>
With the exception of the solitary wound he
had received on the previous day, Jack Lovat
amidst the continuous whistling storms of
bullets, had not received a scratch.  Major
Salkeld was not killed, but had received a
severe wound in the leg which floored him.
Sergeant Oliphant had succumbed to a bullet
through the brain not long after the
commencement of the fight.
</p>

<p>
Nineteen troopers had been slain outright,
four wounded mortally, while six more had
been incapacitated.  Jack Lovat was the only
fighting survivor of the so-called little affair at
Langeman's Drift.
</p>

<p>
The wounds of the living were at once
attended to, and the dead reverently buried,
Colonel Malcolmson officiating as chaplain and
chief mourner.
</p>

<p>
In a consultation with Major Salkeld, the
colonel said, "And you think, Major, that this
commando will concentrate at the Kopje Farm?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt about it, sir.  I believe
that even now the farm may be occupied by
rebels," answered the major.  "You have a
splendid guide in young Lovut, the son of the
owner.  He is a young hero, and deserves a
thousand Victoria Crosses.  Take him with
you, sir, and attack at once."
</p>

<p>
"Your advice is good, Major," said Colonel
Malcolmson.  "I am so sorry you can't come
with us."
</p>

<p>
That was a physical impossibility, and no
one felt more chagrined than the gallant Major
Salkeld.
</p>

<p>
In our next chapter we shall describe the
attack on Kopje Farm, and its results.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
THE FARM RECAPTURED
</h3>

<p>
When the Boers advanced on the Kopje
Farm, Mr. Lovat deemed the policy of
non-resistance to be the wisest course to pursue.
Against the overwhelming numbers of the
Boers there would not have been the slightest
chance of a successful defence, although Pat
O'Neill counselled holding the place at all
costs.  Perhaps it was as well that Jack Lovat
was an absentee, as he certainly would have
backed up Pat's suggestion.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Lovat, weakened in mind and body
by his wound, yielded to his wife's entreaties
to allow the Boers to take what they pleased,
hoping that by so doing he would get rid of
them the sooner.
</p>

<p>
The section of Christian Uys's commando,
now split into several parts, which had
unceremoniously thrust itself upon the master of
the Kopje Farm, was under the command of
a veldt-farmer named Maestral, whose hatred
against the British was of a very pronounced
type.
</p>

<p>
He had entered the precincts of the Kopje
Farm without encountering the slightest
resistance.
</p>

<p>
Simon and Daniel, as related before, had
fortunately escaped.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lovat's stores were ransacked, and
articles of food and clothing wantonly
destroyed.  The ostrich farmer had a plentiful
supply of spirits, mostly in the shape of
Scotch whisky, and the marauders helped
themselves with willing hands, and before long,
discipline became hopelessly lost.
</p>

<p>
Maestral, the field-cornet, although possessing
a cruel and vindictive temperament, was an
abstemious man, and argued, but in vain, with
his intemperate burghers.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have to pay dearly for this," he
said, addressing a rough-looking burgher
named Wessels, who was one of the
ringleaders in the acts of destruction.
</p>

<p>
"Very likely," said Wesseis, with a brutal
leer.  "We have had a rough time of it lately, so
I for one mean to enjoy myself, whenever the
opportunity offers.  The chance may not occur
again."
</p>

<p>
Pat O'Neill could not conceal his anger and
chagrin as he witnessed the looting that went
on, but a hint from a gray-whiskered Boer, that
flesh and bone are not proof against bullets,
induced the Irishman to keep a still tongue in
his head.  So all that Pat could do was to set
his teeth and bear it.
</p>

<p>
Several of the younger members of the
commando had turned the ostriches loose, but
Field-cornet Maestral's threat of using his
sjambok had a salutary effect, and the birds
were re-penned after several exciting chases.
</p>

<p>
The rifles and ammunition found in the
storehouse were confiscated by the Boers, and
the latter were on the point of resuming their
wild orgies when a couple of burghers dashed
up on horseback and inquired for the
field-cornet.  The bloodstains on their horses'
flanks showed that they had ridden hard.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" demanded Maestral.  "You bring
good news, Emil Behrens?"
</p>

<p>
The Boer thus spoken to dismounted from
his panting steed, and exclaimed, "We have
finished off a lot of the rooineks, but"&mdash;this was
added in a whisper&mdash;"a big force of them is
advancing on this place.  The commandant
has ordered the other section of the commando
to scatter, and afterwards concentrate near
Doom Spruit.  Commandant Uys has told us
to acquaint you with the news, and also to ask
you not to hold the farm, as the Rangers will
attempt to retake it, even if it costs them many
men."
</p>

<p>
Field-cornet Maestral was a man endowed
with a large bump of cautiousness, and after
listening to the scout's statement, he with
some difficulty assembled his section of the
commando and addressed a few words to them.
His quick eye noticed that the potent spirit
imbibed by nearly all his burghers had taken
effect and that their gait was unsteady.
</p>

<p>
The Boer officer told the burghers the news
he had just received from the scout Emil
Behrens, who stood by his side, and informed
them that it was his intention to evacuate the
farm.  Loud cries of dissent arose, and as
Maestral did not possess the personality of a
De Wet, he naturally felt, and was, powerless
in the hands of his burghers.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile a strange action was being
performed by Pat O'Neill.  The Dutch settler
who built the Kopje Farm had during its
erection constructed several large cellars, the
ramifications of which extended under many of
the rooms as well as the ostrich kraal.
</p>

<p>
The element of fear had no place in Pat's
mental constitution, and while the field-cornet
was addressing his men, the Irishman
disappeared.  Through a secret trap-door in a
corner of the storeroom floor, he descended
into the enormous cellar.  From his pocket he
took out a small lantern in which was a piece
of tallow candle.  He carefully lighted the
candle, and placed the lantern within a niche
in the wall.
</p>

<p>
Three large barrels stood in a corner of the
cellar, and the barrel lids were removed by
Pat without any difficulty, for the simple
reason that the worthy Irishman had seen
to a little necessary "prising" process soon
after Major Salkeld's men had left in the
morning.
</p>

<p>
With a large scoop, Pat began to bale out a
black substance on the floor.  The substance
was gunpowder!  Quite coolly the Rorke's
Drift man laid a train leading from the barrels
to the foot of the ladder, and with grim
satisfaction viewed his work in the dim light.
</p>

<p>
"Bedad!" he muttered, "this will give the
spalpeens a shock worse than King James av
ancient memory might av got."  Then taking
out a long piece of gutta-percha fuse, he inserted
one end in the train of powder, and ascended
the ladder steps carrying the other end of the
fuse with him.  This end he fixed between
the interstice formed by the floor and the
trap-door.
</p>

<p>
Pat was just in time to see a little of the fun
going on between the field-cornet and his
burghers, and chuckled gleefully to himself.
</p>

<p>
Several gray-haired doppers were backing
up their leader's proposal that the farm should
be evacuated, but the fumes of the whisky were
seething in the noddles of the majority of the
Boers, and their only longing was to get more
of the potent spirit, regardless of consequences.
</p>

<p>
If Commandant Uys had been present,
things might have happened differently; but
discipline had altogether fled, and the only
answer to the field-cornet's command was the
demolition of several additional bottles of the
fiery fluid.  After this, the burghers got
completely out of hand.
</p>

<p>
Pat O'Neill made his way to the dining-room,
where he found his master, Mrs. Lovat,
and Mary.
</p>

<p>
"This is a bad day for us all, sorr," said
Pat respectfully.  "These heathens are clearing
out all we have on the place.  They are drinkin'
harder now, sorr, than anything I've ever seen
in the dear ould counthry across the sea.  I've
got the ould barker wid me, sorr, an' if they
insult Pat O'Neill, they'll have to look out.
You are not well, sorr; remain here until I
return, for you can do no good among the
murtherin' rascals.  Oh, yes, sorr, I will take
due care av myself."
</p>

<p>
Pat, like the majority of his versatile
countrymen, was eloquent in speech, and he added,
"The first man, sorr, who dares to lay his
dirthy fingers on you or the missis or Miss
Mary, I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Pat's sentence was left unfinished, for the
sharp crackle from rifles broke out seemingly
in all directions, followed by loud yells and
shouts in the Dutch tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Begorra!" ejaculated honest Pat, "it's our
bhoys, sorr.  Maybe Master Jack, the darlint
av my eye, is wid them.  No, sorr, you must
not move from here.  You are not well enough.
The saints be praised! afther all, Pat O'Neill
is about to see a good fight once more before
he shuffles off this mortal coil, as the poet says."
</p>

<p>
Saying this, Pat walked to the door of the
dining-room, took out the key, and after
closing the door, locked it, making temporary
prisoners of Mr. Lovat and his little family.
The ostrich farmer was a captive in his own
house.
</p>

<p>
Wild confusion now reigned in the farmyard.
Bullets were whistling all around, and
a dozen Boers lay stretched on the ground,
dead or mortally wounded.
</p>

<p>
In a wild stampede, the Boers climbed over
the walls, only to receive a heavy fire which
dropped several more burghers.  Several of
the Boers were hopelessly intoxicated, and
made no show of resistance.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-176"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-176.jpg" alt="&quot;The Boers climbed over the walls.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;The Boers climbed over the walls.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Hands up, you scoundrels!" yelled a
stentorian voice.  "At them, boys!  Down with
the rascals!  Hurrah!"
</p>

<p>
The speaker was Trooper Morton, who
carrying his rifle in his left hand, dashed
forward in pursuit of the flying burghers.  Close
behind him was Jack Lovat, full of courage,
and several troopers of the corps of Rangers,
all eager to engage the enemy in a hand-to-hand
conflict.
</p>

<p>
The Boers showed little fight, and the
excellent disposition of his men by Colonel
Malcolmson, which was largely due to information
given by Jack Lovat, led to the surrender
of several burghers, without a single casualty
on the British side.
</p>

<p>
Among the captured was Piet Van Donnop,
who along with Emil Behrens had been sent
by Christian Uys to warn Field-cornet
Maestral.
</p>

<p>
Pat O'Neill was almost beside himself with
delight at again meeting his young master.
Jack's first salutation was, "Where are my
father, mother, and Mary, Pat?  I trust they
are all right?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw to that, Master Jack," answered Pat.
"I locked them for safety in the dining-room;"
and the Irishman conducted Jack to the
apartment.
</p>

<p>
The meeting between our hero and his
parents was an affecting one, for the latter
believed that their son was dead.
</p>

<p>
The captured Boers were at once disarmed
by Colonel Malcolmson's troopers, and the
Free Staters placed under a strong guard.
</p>

<p>
Jack had an interview with Piet Donnop.
The young Dutchman told our hero that much of
Commandant Uys's information had been derived
from Moses, who had met his just deserts.
The renegade Kaffir had been shot, with several
others in the service of the Boers, during the
attack on Major Salkeld's men in the donga.
</p>

<p>
After the dead had been buried, Morton and
Jack took a stroll through the storeroom, and
Pat O'Neill came up to them.
</p>

<p>
Respectfully saluting, the Irishman said,
"Sorr, you see that," pointing to a thin black
tube protruding from the trap-door.  "Do you
know what that manes?"
</p>

<p>
The two friends glanced at the fuse, and Pat
seeing that the New Zealander was smoking,
added, "Plase put out your pipe, sorr.  It is
rather dangerous."
</p>

<p>
Wondering greatly what the ex-soldier meant,
Morton obeyed; and Pat raising the trap-door,
said, "If things had gone wrong at the Kopje
Farm, I would have blown the place to
smithereens, an' meself into the bargain.  By
the Rock av Cashel, not one av the spalpeens
would have escaped!  Now, most likely, we
shall have peace."
</p>

<p>
"You're a good fellow, Pat," observed Jack,
with a smile.  "I think, however, the sooner you
get things squared up, the better it will be for
all of us."
</p>

<p>
"I know what ye mane, Masther Jack.  I'll
put the stuff all right;" and shouldering a spade,
the Irishman began to ladle the deadly-looking
powder into the barrel.
</p>

<p>
"That is better," said Jack, as after
having finished his task, Pat replaced the
trap-door.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, Colonel Malcolmson
held a hurried council of war in Mrs. Lovat's
drawing-room, and the gallant colonel invited
the intrepid Morton and our friend Jack to be
present and take part in the proceedings.
</p>

<p>
It was determined to go in pursuit of the
scattered remnants of Christian Uys's
commando; but before this was done, Piet Van
Donnop was brought before the colonel for
examination.
</p>

<p>
Piet had a somewhat crestfallen air, as he
surveyed the group of Britishers.
</p>

<p>
"You are a burgher of the Free State, I
presume?" interrogated the colonel.
</p>

<p>
Van Donnop glanced at Jack Lovat, and
a red glow suffused his bronzed features.
</p>

<p>
"I am waiting for your reply, burgher," said
Colonel Malcolmson brusquely.  "I trust that
my Dutch is good enough for you to understand?"
</p>

<p>
"I am a Cape Colonist, sir," answered Piet
sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
"A Cape rebel, you mean," observed the
colonel sternly.  "How comes it that you are
caught in the act of bearing arms against His
Majesty's Government?"
</p>

<p>
"I am fighting for my own side, sir,"
answered Piet boldly.  "I took up arms because
I was asked, and thought I was doing what
was right."
</p>

<p>
"And you know what may be your fate&mdash;yes,
your possible or rather probable fate?"
was the next interrogation.
</p>

<p>
"I do not," replied Van Donnop, "and I
care very little."
</p>

<p>
"I scarcely wonder at that," said the colonel.
"You certainly seem to have been undergoing
a bad time of it lately.  Have you been here
before?  I mean before the war commenced."
</p>

<p>
"I know him well, sir," put in Jack Lovat,
anticipating Piet's reply.  "He was kind to
me when I was captured by the Boers.  You
will be lenient with him, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Invited by Colonel Malcolmson to say what
he knew about the prisoner, Jack told the
officers of the friendship that had existed
between the two families before hostilities
began, and begged the colonel to be lenient
with Piet.  He urged that the young Dutchman,
like many other settlers in Cape Colony,
had been led astray by Boer emissaries.
</p>

<p>
Before being dismissed by the council, Piet
felt that his life would be safe.  He knew
that by the rules of civilised warfare, he, as a
rebel, had no claim to clemency, and noted
with gratitude Jack Lovat's appeal on his
behalf.
</p>

<p>
The Boer prisoners had been temporarily
imprisoned in the largest ostrich kraal, and a
guard of twenty troopers with loaded rifles
placed over them.  Several of the burghers
were sleeping off the effects of their late
carouse, so that the task of guarding them
was a comparatively easy one.
</p>

<p>
Pat O'Neill now assumed full authority as
foreman of the Kopje Farm, and with more
swagger than was perhaps absolutely necessary,
chaffed the Boers about their inability to hold
a little ostrich farm.  Nor were his eyes and
hands idle.
</p>

<p>
"The dirthy beggars!" muttered Pat.
"They're fond av loot, an' why should not Pat
O'Neill, late av the ould 24th, not follow
suit?"  And to Pat's credit be it said, he
proved a competent detective.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening, Colonel Malcolmson set
off in pursuit of Commandant Uys's scattered
commando, and to his great satisfaction, our
friend Morton, now a full-blown sergeant&mdash;a
rank conferred by Colonel Malcolmson on the
field&mdash;was left in command of the guard,
entrusted with the defence of the Kopje Farm,
and the due supervision of the Boer prisoners
recently captured.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
DIAMONDS GALORE
</h3>

<p>
The troopers left in charge of the Kopje
Farm, after the rest of the Rangers departed,
had many reasons why they should congratulate
themselves on their admirable temporary
quarters.  The New Zealanders for months
had lived "hard," as it is termed in soldier
language.  Now they were, as a trooper
expressed it, "in clover."
</p>

<p>
Most of the men serving in the ranks of the
Rangers were gentlemen by birth, and many
had had a university education.  Sheer love
of adventure had drawn them from the
Antipodes to South Africa, and certainly during
the whole of the unfortunate campaign no corps
serving under the Union Jack did more
yeoman service than the lads from Maoriland.
</p>

<p>
True, they had their failings.  Never
expecting quarter themselves, in the hot rush of
fight, their warlike instincts caused a few, but
very few, regrettable incidents.  The conflict
over, they were the most generous of
opponents, treating the wounded and captured
Boers with the utmost kindness.
</p>

<p>
Peace reigned at the Kopje Farm.  All
outward traces of the late conflict had been
removed before sunset, and Mrs. Lovat had so
far recovered her spirits that she ventured to
walk across to the kraal where the captives
were confined.
</p>

<p>
To the wounded Boers, Mary Lovat was
the model of kindness.  With her deft fingers
she applied linen bandages to their wounds,
brought them beef-tea made by her own hands,
and was most assiduous and tender in her
attentions.
</p>

<p>
War is an awful thing.  The colours that
depict it must always be of a sombre, if not
ebon hue, and Mary Lovat that night earned
the gratitude, often audibly expressed, of
the burghers, smitten, though not mortally,
by the fire from the rifles of the Auckland
Rangers.
</p>

<p>
Pat O'Neill, war-seasoned old veteran that
he was, acted as Mary's trusted adjutant.  He
was here, there, and everywhere; at one
moment giving a wounded Boer a drink of
lemon water, at another listening to the
whisperings of a delirious burgher uttered in
strange tongue, about his late home on the
Modder River.
</p>

<p>
All that was possible under the circumstances
was done.  Colonel Malcolmson, with
generous forethought and self-denial, left his
assistant surgeon at the Kopje Farm.  His
principal medico, Dr. Rennie, had elected to
remain behind with the few surviving wounded
at Langeman's Nek.
</p>

<p>
As the sun was setting, Jack Lovat and his
friend Sergeant Morton took a stroll round the
farm, and their conversation turned to the
subject uppermost in the New Zealander's
mind&mdash;diamonds.
</p>

<p>
"The place you call Diamond Valley is
teeming with stones, I am positive," said
Morton decisively.  "I'm going to explore
the place to-morrow, if nothing turns up to
prevent me."
</p>

<p>
"With not the same results as before, I
hope," observed Jack, with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I shall take my chance," said Morton,
smiling as he spoke.  "I'm convinced from
what I saw that a valuable diamondiferous reef
is in existence in the valley.  I would wager
my bottom sovereign&mdash;only unfortunately I
haven't got one to stake&mdash;to next to nothing
that a fortune awaits the man who exploits
the place.  It is worth a try, at any rate, and
I'm going to make the venture in the morning,
and chance another capture."
</p>

<p>
"We'll go together, then, Sergeant," said
Jack; "and if luck comes in our way, we'll
share and share alike.  Most of the valley
belongs to my father, and if anything turns up, I
know he will be awfully glad to get back to the
old country."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to prevent it, I can assure you, my
lad," observed Morton.  "Who knows what is
lying hid in this wonderful valley of yours?
Perhaps it may contain more diamonds than
are in the Kimberley district."
</p>

<p>
Sergeant Morton was optimistic.  He had
already in his possession stones which he
estimated bore a face value of two thousand
pounds.
</p>

<p>
"We'll go and have a chat now with father
and mother," said Jack; and the two friends
made an adjournment to the room where
Mr. and Mrs. Lovat were seated, discussing the
strange drama that had been enacted at the
Kopje Farm during the past few days.
</p>

<p>
The night passed without alarms.  Sergeant
Morton and Jack never slept, but spent their time
in visiting the sentries judiciously placed around
the farm by the former.  During the night a
couple of wounded Boers succumbed to their
injuries, and were buried in the little paddock
behind the house, now a miniature cemetery.
</p>

<p>
"Bedad, sorr," said Pat O'Neill to Jack after
the burial, "this brings back ould times&mdash;when
I was twenty years younger than I am to-day.
Do you know, sorr, that I thought my blood
was gettin' a bit thin, but by the powers, I'm
spoilin' for another fight.  Maybe, though, it
won't come off.  By the way, sorr, did the masther
get back those five hundred sovereigns the
dirthy curs robbed him of at Jagger's Farm?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid father won't see them again,
Pat," replied Jack.  "The poor beggars are
welcome to keep them.  They have had a
stiffish time of it lately.  I hardly think they
will make an attack on the Kopje Farm again.
What is it, Pat?  Why are you fumbling in
your waistcoat?"
</p>

<p>
"I've got a bit av loot, Masther Jack,"
answered Pat.  "No, sorr, not your father's
sovereigns;" and the Irishman drew out a dirty
chamois-leather bag.
</p>

<p>
Dipping his hand into the bag, Pat withdrew
ten Kruger sovereigns and showed them to
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Been looting, I see, Pat," said Jack
laughingly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sorr, they took the masther's gold,"
observed Pat, with a grin, "an' thinks I,
as the ould sayin' goes, fair exchange is no
robbery.  Av course, sorr, I've been on the
look-out for a bit av loot.  You will take the
coins, Masther Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, my dear fellow; keep them yourself,
if your conscience will allow you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a thafe, sorr," said Pat.  "I only
thought that all was fair in love an'
war&mdash;although, the saints be praised, Pat O'Neill has
never been such a fool as to fall in love wid
any woman yet."
</p>

<p>
"I meant no harm, Pat," observed Jack.
"You get more fiery as you get older."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Masther Jack; I'll stick to the
money until your father gets back his five
hundred pounds.  But I got something else
from the burgher I took these from."
</p>

<p>
"And pray what is that?" inquired Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Only a few glass stones, sorr," replied the
Irishman; and he stretched out his palm, on
which reposed a dozen or more little "glass
stones."
</p>

<p>
"I think they're diamonds, sorr," said Pat,
"but I'm no hand at knowing jewellery."
</p>

<p>
Sergeant Morton was passing on his way to
the ostrich kraal, and Jack called to him.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Lovat!  What is it?" inquired the
Colonial.  "Anything the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Kindly look at these glass stones, as Pat
calls them," said Jack; and Morton glanced at
the pebbles, after which he looked significantly
at our hero.
</p>

<p>
"You might point out the burgher from
whom you got these, Pat," said Jack.  "I
should very much like to see the fellow who is
fond of carrying pieces of glass about with
him."
</p>

<p>
"Then they are only glass, sorr?" inquired
the Irishman, a shade of disappointment
creeping over his face.
</p>

<p>
"I can hardly say they are glass, at the
present time, Pat," replied Jack.  "However,
I want to see the burgher from whom you took
the crystals."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sorr," observed Pat, with alacrity.
"Come wid me, an' I'll show you the burgher.
He's a rough-looking customer, and big enough
to eat the three av us up."
</p>

<p>
Saying this, Pat led the way to the ostrich
kraal.  The imprisoned Boers looked very
dejected, and anything but the fierce fighters
recently serving in Christian Uys's commando.
</p>

<p>
Pat walked up straight to a Free Stater of
immense size and stature.  The Boer possessed
a most forbidding countenance, and scowled as
Pat approached.
</p>

<p>
"This is the man, sorr, I took the coins an'
crystals from," said Pat.
</p>

<p>
"Then hand the coins back to him.  They
belong to him," observed Jack.
</p>

<p>
Pat at once handed over the Kruger
sovereigns to the big burgher, whose face
instantly assumed a suaver expression.
</p>

<p>
"We British try to be just," said Jack in
Dutch.  "I am sorry that my father's servant
took the money from you.  Do you mind
telling me where you obtained these?"  Saying
this, Jack showed the crystals to the
burgher.
</p>

<p>
"I picked them up in a sluit not far from
here.  I thought they would make a necklace
for my daughter."
</p>

<p>
"And you know what they are?" inquired
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Crystals," answered the Boer.  "They are
very plentiful in my country, but have not the
same yellow colour as these."
</p>

<p>
"Will you sell them to me?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"No, I will not take anything," answered the
burgher; "I will give them to you.  You have
restored my money, and I am content."
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat was honest, and as he turned
away with Sergeant Morton, said to the Boer,
"I will see you again."
</p>

<p>
Jack and his New Zealand friend returned to
the house, and for an hour were shut up in the
former's room.
</p>

<p>
Morton examined the crystals very carefully,
while Jack awaited his verdict with considerable
anxiety.  At last the New Zealander
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"They are diamonds, Jack, sure enough, but
not of the same quality as the stones I possess,
or the one Kaffir Pete gave you.  You see
these have a yellow tint distributed unevenly
throughout their substance.  If the tint had
been deeper and of a uniform nature throughout,
the pebbles would represent a value of
three thousand pounds at least.  The majority
of them are fractured, too.  I should hand
them back to the Boer.  After you have done
that, we'll make tracks for Diamond Valley.
I don't suppose we shall meet with the same
adventure as we did before.  The place seems
quiet enough now."
</p>

<p>
Jack acted on Sergeant Morton's suggestion,
and offered to restore the stones to the Boer
from whom they were taken; but the latter, to
our hero's surprise, refused to accept them,
saying, "Keep them; I can get more when I
return to my own country.  I thank you all the
same for your kindness."
</p>

<p>
An hour later, after a consultation with
his father and mother, Jack stood under
the verandah of the farmhouse, waiting for
Sergeant Morton, who was making an inspection
of the sentries and guards.  It was a
beautiful day, and the sky was without a cloud.
Brilliant sunshine flooded the scene, and down
in the valley the heat hung quiveringly above
the veldt.
</p>

<p>
Only a few hours had passed since a scene
of bloodshed and violence was being enacted
at the Kopje Farm.  Now all is peaceful and
still, while the silence is almost oppressive.
</p>

<p>
Leisurely Sergeant Morton sauntered up
to where Jack was standing, and in his
rear stalked Mr. Lovat's faithful henchman, Pat.
</p>

<p>
"All is serene, Jack," said the New Zealander,
as he came up.  "I don't think we shall see
or hear anything of our fellows until evening.
So come along.  I've told Pat to be on the
alert, and to bring us word instantly should
any change in the situation take place."
</p>

<p>
"You understand, Pat," said Jack to the
Irishman, who was standing at attention, "if
any one turns up, you will at once come over
the kopje to us.  Here are my glasses, and be
sure you keep a sharp look-out."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sorr," answered Pat; "I understand.
But mind you, don't go and get
captured again, sorr."
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed, and linking his arm within the
New Zealander's, the two friends began
climbing the kopje in the direction of Diamond
Valley.
</p>

<p>
Both were well armed, Jack having a Lee-Enfield
rifle, while Morton carried a Mauser,
with the use of which he was well acquainted.
The Mauser formed part of the spoil taken in
the previous day's fight.
</p>

<p>
"If we can find poor Pete's body, we'll bury
him decently," said Jack.  "He was a good
and faithful servant of my father's."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid there will scarcely be any
necessity for that," observed Morton.  "The
aasvogels, I am afraid, will have been at work."
</p>

<p>
The summit of the kopje was soon reached,
and presently Jack and his companion were
overlooking the immense depression known as
the Diamond Valley.
</p>

<p>
Jack led the way straight to where the Kaffir
Pete had been killed, and to his great satisfaction
found that the poor black's body had been
left untouched by the loathsome birds of prey,
although several of them could be seen hovering
in the air at some distance away.
</p>

<p>
Our hero insisted upon Pete having a decent
temporary interment, and a hollow was soon
found, in which the "boy" was placed, and
covered with stones and earth.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Jack, my boy, we must make tracks
for the diamonds," said Morton, after the
burying operations were completed.  "Hullo!"
he added.  "Look out, Jack!"
</p>

<p>
The New Zealander, one of the coolest
Irregulars serving in the campaign, was
speaking in an excited tone of voice.
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat turned his head in surprise.
Not more than a yard from him, a huge black
snake, with uplifted head and ominous-looking
poison fangs, was preparing to hurl itself on the
young settler.
</p>

<p>
In a moment Jack took in the situation, and
sprang aside.  A rifle report rang out, and the
loathsome reptile fell at Jack's feet, an inert
mass of dead matter.  A bullet from Sergeant
Morton's rifle had shattered the snake's head.
</p>

<p>
"A near squeak that, Jack," said Morton,
with a laugh.  "They tell me that a bite from
one of these snakes means almost instant
death."
</p>

<p>
"I'm jolly glad, Sergeant, you warned me,
and better still, hit the brute.  I'm awfully
obliged to you."
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it, Jack.  And now for that
little blue reef!" responded the sergeant.  "I
trust we shall be able to find it."
</p>

<p>
"I think I can locate it," said Jack; "it is
somewhere down here."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, Jack," observed Morton.
"The side of the donga rose almost
perpendicularly, I remember.  A band of blue clay
runs horizontally along the gneiss.  Why, here
we are.  This is the very place where the
nigger said he found the pebble you showed
me.  I've come prepared this time, Jack;" and
the sergeant drew a formidable-looking
bill-hook from his belt.
</p>

<p>
"I've gone one better than that," said Jack,
with a smile, as he took a small pickaxe from
his pocket and placed it in a shaft which he
had brought from the farm.
</p>

<p>
"The very thing, Jack!" cried Morton.
"Why, you're a trump!"
</p>

<p>
"Living on the veldt makes you sharp," said
Jack drily.
</p>

<p>
Morton took the pickaxe and began hewing
at the band of blue clay.
</p>

<p>
"No, leave it alone, Jack," said the sergeant,
as Jack stooped to pick up the clay.  "I may
hit you, and that would be a very bad ending
to what I consider a promising career."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Sergeant," responded Jack
cheerfully.  "Then I'll stand by and see you do the
hard work, while I share the profits."
</p>

<p>
For a few moments, Sergeant Morton applied
the pickaxe vigorously, then a ringing sound
followed the blows.
</p>

<p>
"A selvage pocket!" muttered the New
Zealander, as he scooped out the remnants of
clay.  "Hard luck, Jack, the worst of bad luck.
The pocket has given out.  It can't be helped.
And now let us examine our spoil."
</p>

<p>
With trembling fingers, it must be confessed,
Sergeant Morton proceeded to examine the
blue clay he had dislodged, while Jack with a
big clasp knife followed suit.
</p>

<p>
An exclamation burst from the New
Zealander.
</p>

<p>
"Jack!" he cried excitedly, "we are both
made men!" and he showed to our hero a
substance rather larger than a walnut.
</p>

<p>
"This is a klip, Jack; one of the finest South
Africa has yet produced.  I must rest a while;
I'm too excited to do any more;" and the
cool-headed New Zealander, the man who had
been in a hundred fights without showing the
slightest trace of fear, sat down, and with great
difficulty restrained himself from shedding
tears.
</p>

<p>
Poverty and its attendant struggles would
be a thing of the past, and, in his Antipodean
home, the war-worn Ranger would be able to
share in the luxuries and happiness which
wealth, if judiciously used, can bestow on its
fortunate recipients.
</p>

<p>
Several additional diamonds of large size
were found by Morton and Jack in the blue
clay dislodged from the selvage pocket.  These
were carefully gathered, and the two friends
were on the point of returning to the Kopje
Farm, when they saw a figure silhouetted
against the skyline.
</p>

<p>
"I fancy it is Pat," said Jack.  "I wonder
what news he brings.  I trust Colonel
Malcolmson has captured the commando."
</p>

<p>
"I hope such may be the case," observed
the New Zealander.  "However, let us move
forward as rapidly as we can, and ascertain
what is the matter."
</p>

<p>
The new-comer proved to be Pat, and the
worthy Irishman seemed to be somewhat
flurried.
</p>

<p>
"I've come as ye tould me, sorr," said Pat,
as the two friends came up.
</p>

<p>
"Any news?" inquired Jack.
</p>

<p>
"The best av news, sorr," answered Pat.
"It would take more than half a dozen
commandos to take the Kopje Farm now."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Pat?  I don't quite
understand."
</p>

<p>
"I mane that a rigimint av English Lancers
is now at the farmstead, and some av the
Rangers are expected soon.  There has been
a big fight close to Springbokfontein, and the
Boers have been badly licked by our men, and
the burgher they call Uys has been captured
wid all his baggage.  You are going home
now, sorr, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"That is so, Pat," answered Jack; and we
may rest assured that the distance between the
summit of the kopje and the farm was covered
in record time.
</p>

<p>
Pat's information proved correct; for three
squadrons of British Lancers were temporarily
resting at Mr. Lovat's ostrich farm.
</p>

<p>
Jack was greatly impressed by the appearance
of the Lancers.  Most of the soldiers
were young men, but all looked fit and hardy.
Theirs had been a rough life for many months,
trekking up and down the colony in search
of rebel bands.
</p>

<p>
Major Lambton, who commanded the
Lancers, proved an affable gentleman, and
received Jack with the greatest courtesy.
Sergeant Morton half expected a wigging for
being absent from his post, but escaped the
infliction.
</p>

<p>
A couple of despatch riders had ridden over
from Springbokfontein, conveying the news of
the Boers' defeat, and also a command that the
prisoners captured at the Kopje Farm should
be hurried down to the town at the earliest
moment.  Half a dozen troopers were to be
left at the farm, if Mr. Lovat so desired.
</p>

<p>
Major Lambton decided to leave a half troop
of his Lancers with the ostrich farmer, while
with the remainder of his command he
intended to join Colonel Malcolmson.
</p>

<p>
Jack obtained permission from his father,
although it was not readily accorded, to proceed
with Sergeant Morton to Springbokfontein.
Our hero felt sorry for Piet Van Donnop and
his comrades, who appeared very dejected.
The journey, too, had to be performed on
foot over a rough country.
</p>

<p>
The wounded Boers were left in the ostrich
kraal, until arrangements for them to be
conveyed to Springbokfontein could be completed.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the afternoon when Jack and
Morton arrived at the town.  A big fight had
taken place in the early morning between the
Rangers and the now concentrated commando
of the redoubtable Christian Uys.
</p>

<p>
It had proved a stubborn encounter; but
the Rangers, under the brilliant leadership of
Colonel Malcolmson, forced the fighting, and
after much slaughter on both sides, the Boers
ran up the white flag, and the action ceased.
</p>

<p>
Christian Uys, Veldt-cornet Steyn, and
several officers were taken prisoners, and
lodged in the Town Hall at Springbokfontein.
It was evident that the Boers had sympathisers
in the town, for many scowling looks were
bestowed on the Lancers and the Rangers,
escorting the prisoners captured at the Kopje
Farm.
</p>

<p>
To Jack's great delight, he found that the
British wounded had arrived from Langeman's
Nek, and although Major Salkeld was severely
wounded, the doctor had great hopes of his
complete recovery.
</p>

<p>
Jack Lovat had an object in visiting
Springbokfontein, and soon after his arrival he sought
and obtained an interview with Colonel
Malcolmson.
</p>

<p>
Jack was accompanied by Sergeant Morton,
and in an open though respectful manner he
made known his errand to the colonel.
</p>

<p>
"I have come to make inquiries about my
father's money, sir," began Jack.  "He was
robbed of five hundred pounds a few days
ago, by some Boers belonging to the
commando you have captured."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I see, my boy; you are Mr. Lovat's
son," said the colonel.  "I must congratulate
you on the splendid spirit you have shown
during this very trying time.  You have a
perfect right to make every inquiry.  I know, of
course, about the robbery, for such it was, I
am shortly having an interview with
Commandant Uys and his veldt-cornet.  If you
wish, you can go with me, and you as
well, Sergeant Morton.  I believe the back
of the rebellion is broken in this part of the
colony."
</p>

<p>
Jack thanked the colonel for his courtesy,
and said that he should be pleased if he could
have an opportunity of speaking to the
commandant.  A few minutes later, Jack
stood before the redoubtable Boer leader.
</p>

<p>
Uys was confined, along with several of his
officers, in a large room in the Town Hall.
Several of the Boer officers with him had been
wounded, but there was a haughty look on all
their faces.  Although captured, their spirits
were not broken.
</p>

<p>
The commandant opened his eyes in
astonishment as he beheld Jack, who returned
the gaze with interest.
</p>

<p>
"I have come to ask about my father's
money, Commandant," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"What money?" demanded Uys.
</p>

<p>
"The money of which he was robbed by
your brigands," answered Jack boldly in
Dutch.
</p>

<p>
"You are the young rooinek who escaped
from my laager?" inquired the commandant.
</p>

<p>
"I am," replied Jack stolidly.
</p>

<p>
"After killing one of my best burghers,"
said the Boer leader in a stern tone of voice.
</p>

<p>
"You say so," said Jack.  "It is a time of
war, and many men are being killed daily.  I
have come to ask about my father's money,
of which he was robbed at Jagger's Farm.
He was not, and is not even now, at war with
your race."
</p>

<p>
"I have not your father's money," observed
Uys.  "If I had, I would restore it to you.  I
cannot always restrain my burghers."
</p>

<p>
"But you are responsible for their actions,
Commandant," said Jack boldly.  "Your men
also without provocation attacked my father's
farm, but our Kaffirs and I repelled their
assault."
</p>

<p>
"One question, youngster.  I have given you
an honest answer to a straight question.  Who
was your companion when we captured you in
the donga?" asked Uys.
</p>

<p>
"He is here to answer for himself,
Commandant.  His name is Morton;" and Jack
stepped to one side, saying as he did so,
"Allow me, Commandant, to introduce Sergeant
Morton of the Auckland Rangers to you."
</p>

<p>
The Boer leader frowned, and muttered,
"I thought so!  He is a lucky fellow."
</p>

<p>
Finding that he could derive no satisfaction
from the answers given to his inquiries
respecting his father's money, Jack bowed to the
commandant and retired.
</p>

<p>
A couple of hours later, our hero found
himself at the Kopje Farm, relating to his
parents the adventures of the day, and when
he flung himself on his bed, he felt that peace
once more had come to dwell around his
father's farmstead.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p>
Two years have passed away since the
incidents recorded in this little book happened.
</p>

<p>
Under the silken folds of the Union Jack,
Dutch and British alike enjoy the same liberties
and privileges; but it is not of the land under
the brilliant Southern Cross that we now
write.
</p>

<p>
The purple heather is blooming on the
moors and hillsides of bonnie Scotland, and
in the glens shots are heard.  Grouse-shooting
has commenced in the Highlands, and a party
of four are stalking through the heather, on
sport intent.
</p>

<p>
One is a young lady, just blossoming into
glorious womanhood.  She is a keen sportswoman,
and can handle a gun as well as the
best of them.  Her name is Miss Lovat, and
she is the sister of the Laird of Airdtullish.
Her face is darker than those of the majority
of her fair countrywomen, but veldt breezes and
scorching sunshine have the knack of tanning
faces belonging to those of European birth.
</p>

<p>
Her companion is a gentleman of soldierly
appearance, with a decided limp in his gait.
The hair shading his temples is tinged with
gray, although he is not yet forty.  The quiet,
soldierly man is our friend Major Salkeld,
whose gallant defence against big odds in the
donga over against Diamond Valley is recorded
in the annals of the Auckland Rangers.
</p>

<p>
Since the grouse-shooting began, he has
been Miss Lovat's devoted companion.
</p>

<p>
Let us glance at the remaining couple.
Both are men, broad-shouldered and
clean-flanked.  We have met them before; for the
younger man is our old friend Jack Lovat,
and his companion Charlie Morton, head
partner in the big diamond-broking firm of
Morton &amp; Company, Hatton Garden.
</p>

<p>
Jack's father is dead, and lies in the little
cemetery at Orangefontein.  The blow received
from the clubbed rifle at Jagger's Farm
inflicted a more severe wound than was at first
imagined, and he gradually sickened and died.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lovat is still in the land of the living,
but remains in delicate health.  She is lovingly
watched over by Mary and Jack, who are
doing their best to smooth the dark passage
leading to the life beyond.
</p>

<p>
There is another character who acts the <i>rôle</i>
of butler at Airdtullish Castle whom we must
present to our readers.  He is our honest
friend Pat O'Neill, formerly the faithful
henchman of Mr. Lovat, and now of his son.  His
tongue is as voluble as ever, and nothing
delights him more than to recount the deeds
of the young laird of Airdtullish to the servants
at the Castle.
</p>

<p>
Morton and Jack are engaged in conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I often think about those five hundred
sovereigns, Jack, which the Boers sneaked
from your father.  You never saw them again,
I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed as he replied, "Well, perhaps
I never did rest my optics upon the identical
coins; but Colonel Malcolmson saw that my
father had their value in horses, before he took
Maestral's commando to Springbokfontein.  My
father certainly lost nothing by the bargain.
It was rather fortunate in one sense that the
Boers robbed him."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" inquired the
diamond merchant.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you would never have seen the
Diamond Valley and Airdtullish.  Our paternal
home would never have been mine.  I deeply
grieve, however, for my father."
</p>

<p>
The pair relapsed into silence, and stood for
a few moments gazing at the purple-clad
mountains in the west.  Here we must leave
them, and say "Au revoir!" to the quartette,
and to our boy readers who have followed the
fortunes of the inmates of the Kopje Farm.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
